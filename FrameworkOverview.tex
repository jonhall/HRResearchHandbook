\chapter{The 5-stage Masters project framework \label{chp:framework}}
This handbook gives you a 5-stage framework with which to approach your research project. The framework has been refined over many years of working with hundreds of Masters students at the Open University\footnote{If you know anything about the Open University, you'll know that it is a distance--learning university, most of its students work at a distance and so don't attend lectures. If you think about it, the ``at--a--distance'' model is precisely what you'll be doing in your Masters project -- you won't have lectures! This makes the Open University model really appropriate for a Master project.}, UK.

We provide an overview in this chapter --- we will break the framework down into stages in the following chapters, each chapter giving detailed guidance for that stage.

\section{What do we mean by framework?}
Writing a Master dissertation is a complex task: the goal is a complete 10,000--15,000 word dissertation on the research you have conducted which meets the required academic standards. There are many risks that you will face in writing it, which include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Misunderstanding what is required

\item Running out of time

\item Not having the skills or resources you need

\item Choosing the wrong methods or techniques, or not applying them correctly
\item Not having access to the evidence you need
\item or simply, life getting in the way.
\end{itemize}

Our framework will allow you to manage these risks to give you the best chance of submitting something that will satisfy the examiners and show your Masters research skills off in their best light.

The framework comes with recommended stages and research activities, as well as metrics and guidelines to help you parameterise your project based on your course requirements, develop a work plan that meets your needs, and manage your work and your interaction with your supervisor effectively.

Study within our framework and you'll have your best chance of succeeding.

Because the key research requirement is for new knowledge, every Masters student will be working at the leading edge of their discipline. One corollary of this is that every dissertation will be different. Your project will allow you to show how your domain expertise in a focussed topic has developed through your studies and your dissertation will reflect that. That's your goal!

For us in defining our framework, it raises a problem -- we cannot possibly know the details of your final dissertation. We can't know even simple things, like how many pages it will have exactly. We can't know what your arguments will be or what your conclusions or future work will contain. Neither can we know which literature you will consult, what the seminal paper in it is.

That would be a problem if our focus was only on the final form your dissertation will take. But we don't!

What we teach in this handbook is the process of arriving at your final dissertation. That's why we structure our framework into stages -- each stage building on the previous, each moving you further down the line to your final dissertation. And because we have seen literally hundreds of students follow the framework as we have developed it, we know it can work and work well. 

If this has convinced you that we're onto something, welcome aboard!

Your first step with us will be to learn about the research process that you will follow.

\section{The research process and its key activities}\label{sect:researchactivities}
A research process is the sequence of activities you undertake when conducting academic research.

Research is messy --- looking into the unknown means there is no road map to follow and you will often have to retrace your steps and try different paths. So, moderate your expectations -- you shouldn't expect a linear, orderly research process!

Instead, the research process is an iterative, incremental, and adaptive process of knowledge discovery --- it iterates through its research activities in small incremental steps, adapting as your knowledge grows.

The exact path you will follow in your research project will be unique to you. However, you will go through some widely recognised activities, which are common to all research processes.

\subsection{Identifying the research problem}
A key concept in academic research is that of \emph{research problem}. A research problem captures the knowledge gap to be addressed (\emph{the need}) by the research within a particular field of study (\emph{the context}). A well-defined research problem is the foundation of any research project as it clarifies the purpose of the research and its intended outcomes.

In this handbook, you will learn a practical approach to identifying and articulating your chosen research project.

\subsection{Reviewing the literature}
One of the major tasks you will have in compiling your dissertation is to give the reader sufficient background that they can check where you're coming from. To do so, you will be referring to the work of other authors and researchers throughout your project: this is collectively known as the academic literature. Depending on your degree, you may already have practise in doing this in your previous studies, for instance in writing academic essays for your assignments. For your Masters, however, the more definitive you can be in referencing the academic literature the better. This means that your review of the academic literature will be a significant part of your research project.

Your review has two key functions.

Firstly, it will help you contextualise your research in what is already known and where the knowledge gaps are, so that you can focus your research more tightly on a research problem which is relevant and significant to your field of study. This includes evaluating your own findings against those of others in your field.

Secondly, it will help you understand how to conduct your research: by reading your field's literature, you'll learn what is academically acceptable in terms of the methods and techniques which you can apply to address your research problem.

Reviewing the literature is both time consuming and demanding, and will require you to apply many skills which this handbook will help you develop.

\subsection{Setting your aim and objectives}
While your research problem helps you establish the contribution to knowledge of your research, your aim and objectives will help you establish the scope and boundaries of your project by stating the specific way in which your research will address the problem.

Scoping your project appropriately is necessary in all research, but is particularly critical at Masters level with its many constraints on the time you have and the methods you can feasibly apply.

\subsection{Developing the research design}
Your research design will summarise, explain and justify how your research is conducted for the benefit of your examiners and other readers\footnote{Although we all want to think differently, it is often the case that the examiners are the only people outside of your supervisory relationship that will read your dissertation. We'll talk later about how you can get your family involved -- which may double your readership!}. As with your literature review, it will develop during your project: at the start, it will be a collection of your initial ideas; by the end, it will be an account of what you did.

Your research design will depend on many things. There are some obvious ones, including the type of research problem you are trying to address, the intended outcome of your research, the sort of evidence you will need, and the research strategies and methods that are acceptable within your chosen discipline.

There are others that are less obvious: you'll have to tailor your research design to the resources and expertise you easily have access to, and your preferred research style\footnote{You may have heard of a \emph{learning style}. A research style is similar -- you may prefer, for instance, to talk to people about the practical ways they work as opposed to building theories of how they do so.}. As a key participant in your own research, your own personal views and values will also affect your choices while developing your research design.

There are also some esoteric ones: some philosophical beliefs which are shared by researchers in your field in regard of how knowledge can be generated. Although fascinating, to really understand them well takes decades of study of others' writings, on top of which there will be hours on hours of conversations with other researchers. Clearly, this is not something you will have much time to dwell upon in your Masters project --- you have a supervisor that can advice you, instead.

Research design is a field of study in its own right, one which has grown out of the many different academic traditions and ways of thinking across academic disciplines and subject areas. It's not easy to digest and is far from stable or complete: every so often a new book on research methods will be offered for review by a publisher. Research design is possibly one of the most challenging aspects of doing academic research and can be puzzling\footnote{It can sometimes be puzzling for experienced researchers too!} for those just starting.

Because of this, you should rely on your supervisor for advice, particularly at the beginning, although your understanding will mature during your project. This handbook will help you develop such an understanding and assess which choices are most appropriate for your project.

\subsection{Gathering and analysing evidence}
This is where you use your research design to gather and analyse the data and evidence\footnote{Data is raw information with no interpretation attached, while evidence is information interpreted to support your academic arguments. The two are closely linked, with data forming the basis of evidence, so that they are often used interchangeably. We will return to this topic in Section~\ref{sect:evidenceAndData}.} you need for your project. This is possibly the most exciting part of conducting academic research!

You're going to spend a lot of time doing this, and you'll have to circle back\footnote{One PhD student we know got to within 2 months of finishing their PhD when they realised that their research design led them to incorrect data analysis. That was a real critical moment in their studies, but they got it done in the end. Just.} to this activity as you learn more about your field and as your research develops.

\subsection{Interpreting and evaluating findings}
This is where you review your findings critically to establish the extent your research has met its stated aim and objectives. Because it relies on the way you interpret your evidence, it is closely related to and typically influences evidence gathering and analysis, so that you will iterate between these two research activities for a large proportion of your project.

\subsection{Reporting}
Throughout your project you will need to report in a critical\footnote{Developing your critical voice is, er, critical to being a successful researcher. On a good capstone project, an effective critical voice will be highly valued by your examiners.} and rigorous manner on all aspects of your research, including both new insights and the process you followed to arrived at them. Therefore, integral to your reporting is a critical appraisal of the strengths and limitations of the research you have conducted, the overall conclusions which can be drawn from it and what the impact on future research might be.

While your course may only require you to submit a final dissertation for assessment, it is essential that you write up reports throughout your project. This will allow you to improve your academic writing skills, share what you have done with your supervisor for feedback and formative assessment, and develop your dissertation incrementally.

\subsection{Reflecting}
Reflection is what makes your learning more effective, and relevant and useful to your own practice. Reflection is important in any kind of learning, but particularly in the experiential learning\footnote{Experiential learning is `learning by doing,' using reflection to think critically about what you have experienced and relate it to knowledge and how it can apply to new situations.} of conducting research.

Our framework therefore emphasises reflection as an essential activity within the research process, to develop and consolidate the knowledge and skills you need to be a competent and confident researchers.

\subsection{Planning work}
Some researchers will have worked much of their lives on one problem. You don't have that luxury -- or burden, depending on your perspective!

Time-bound research, like that you are just about to start, must be planned carefully as early mistakes and missteps can be very difficult to correct later.

For this reason, we recommend that you build a \emph{work plan}. At its core, a work plan summarises all activities and work to be conducted to complete the research, how to organise and execute them in the time-span of the project and which milestones must be met.

Standard project management techniques apply, but with the caveat that in academic research you are usually planning for the unknown, so not everything can be figured out upfront and some level of adaptation will be needed. Hence, understanding what might change, related risk and how to manage it is an essential part of  planning your research project.

\subsection{Managing risk}
Risk captures the likelihood of something going wrong combined with the impact that will have on your project, both on time, resources and outcome. In theory, both positive and negative impacts can be assessed, but very often the focus is on what can affect your project in a bad way. It is essential that you make an assessment of risk at the start of your project and identify ways to manage it, then monitor and adjust as you go along.

\subsection{How the activities relate to each other}
Figure~\ref{fig:researchactivities} depicts the relations between activities in the research process: as you can see, these are complex relationships, with much tangling and intertwining. Note also that reflecting, reporting, work planning and risk management apply to both individual activities, and the process overall, which is why in the figure they are separated from the other activities.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{researchActivities.pdf}
\caption{Research activities and their relations}
\label{fig:researchactivities}
\end{figure}

The main relations between activities are as follows (with reference to the numbering in the figure):

\begin{enumerate}
\item The research problem helps you identify relevant literature to review
\item The literature you review helps you identify current knowledge and existing gaps and frame the research problem
\item The research problem informs what the aim and objectives should be
\item The research problem identifies the phenomena under study, which inform your choice of research strategy and methods within your research design
\item The literature also helps you establish which research strategy and methods to apply and how
\item The objectives inform the research strategy and methods to discharge them
\item The research designs tells you how to gather and analyse evidence
\item The analysis of evidence feeds your interpretation and evaluation
\item Your interpretation and evaluation may require further evidence gathering and analysis
\item Your interpretation and evaluation assess the extent aim and objectives are discharged
\item Aim and objectives gives you criteria for your evaluation and interpretation
\item Activities feed your project plan
\item Your work plan informs what you have to do and when
\item Activities give rise to risk to be managed
\item Managing risk will constrain the way you carry out activities
\item Activities and their outputs must be documented in your reports
\item Your reflection on all you do will trigger changes and adjustments to all your activities
\end{enumerate}

The figure highlights the interconnected nature of everything you do during a research project, and how the need to revisit some activities, perhaps as the result of reflection, will trigger adjustments to others which are closely related, so that there is no linear path through that all projects will follow. The figure also does not assume there is a set starting point, although, as you will see in the next chapter, identifying the research problem from an initial topic is the way we recommend you get your project started. Equally, research can go on forever as reflecting of what you know may trigger new avenues of enquiry to follow. Of course, in the context of a Masters project you only have a set amount of time to complete your work, so that at some point you will need to decide that you have done enough and finalise your project dissertation.

\section{The 5-stage framework for your research}\label{sect:5stageFramework}

This handbook recommends you organise your research project into five major stages. We've developed our 5-stage framework from our experience of working with hundreds of successful\footnote{And a few, a very few, unsuccessful ones{\ldots}} Masters research students, our knowledge of the iterative, incremental and adaptive nature of the research process, and our awareness of the many risks that must be managed to be successful.

Given this, the stages have the following characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
\item Each stage contains many interrelated research activities\footnote{Don`t worry, we're going to go into exhaustive detail about this the remainder of the book!}, so that you will often revisit earlier activities as you learn more about research and move forward in your project. From one stage to the next, however, the balance between those activities will change reflecting your increasing expertise in them and the progress you have made

\item Each stage builds incrementally and adaptively on work from the previous stage(s)

\item Each stage includes critical reflection on what you have achieved and learned, and how this should inform the work ahead

\item Each stage includes some report writing so that your dissertation builds with your expertise

\item Each stage includes re-assessing risk and adapting your work plan.

\end{itemize}

Because it sets up the whole research project, in Stage 1, alongside developing a deeper knowledge of the research process and its activities, you will do lots of prep, including identifying your project's scope and potential contribution to knowledge, doing an initial risk assessment, outlining an initial work plan, and setting up the relationship with your supervisor.

Given a successful set up of your research in Stage 1, from Stage 2 onwards you'll spend more time on the specifics of your research and less on the process\footnote{Which will probably come as welcome relief:)}. Even so, in each stage, you will need to review your project risk and progress, adjusting your project plan accordingly.

The 5 stages are designed to balance the activities you need to carry out in your project; each is allocated a recommended proportion of the overall project time, as outlined in Figure~\ref{fig:slugDiagram}. Their precise balance is influenced by many factors, including topic, your previous research experience, if any, and your supervisor's advice, so take the figure with a pinch of salt -- it's only meant to show you how the focus on research activities changes in the stages. We will consider more detailed descriptions by stage in the follow-up chapters, including indicative timings, but again, nothing is written in stone.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/slugDiagram.pdf}
\caption{Change of focus between research activities across the project stages}
\label{fig:slugDiagram}
\end{figure}

\begin{question}[subtitle={Activity: Considering the stages and activities in the framework }] Consider Figure~\ref{fig:slugDiagram} carefully, taking notice of which activities are more prominent in each stage, and the relative length of each stage within the framework. Jot down a timeline for your project based on your expected study length in weeks, identifying when each stage starts and ends.

\begin{solution}Some activities are more prominent in the early stages, specifically identifying the research problem and reviewing the literature. Others become prominent in later stages, particularly gathering and analysing evidence, and interpreting and evaluating findings. Others still, feature throughout the project: this is particularly the case for reflecting and reporting.

Your timeline will be specific to your project, of course. Say, you have 48 weeks in total. Then, Stage 1 will take 15\% of 48 weeks, or just over 7 weeks, Stage 2 will take the same length, Stage 3 will take 20\% of 48 weeks, or just under 10 weeks, etc.

\end{solution}\end{question}

In the following chapters we will break down the research activities, stage by stage, indicating what is expected at each stage to help your organise and plan your project work in some detail. Alongside, we will provide recommendations on critical aspects of your work you should discuss with your supervisor: this should help you guide your interaction with your supervisor, ask key questions and make the time you spend together more productive.

In practice, your supervisor will only have limited time to dedicate to your project, therefore it is essential you make an effective use of that time: the advice in the table will help you guide your interaction with your supervisor, ask key questions and make the time you spend together more productive.

\section{Critical success factors}\label{sect:successFactors}

We conclude this chapter by summarising critical success factors you should keep in mind during your Masters research:

\paragraph{Making good use of the 5-stage framework}  The framework in this handbook is the result of decades of practice, helping Masters students like you succeeding in they first academic project. However, it is not a straightjacket, and you should adapt it to your own needs. The framework was developed with the novice academic researcher in mind, but it may be that you already have some research experience, in which case some of the the timing suggested by the framework may be too generous. Equally, your own course may require you to submit some interim report as formative assessment, in which case the stages length may need altering to match your course requirements. Nevertheless, the framework provides a scaffolding to help you take control when planning and conducting your project.

\paragraph{Making good use of this handbook and its activities}  This handbook is designed to accompany you in your first journey into academic research, so you should follow its stage by stage advice to guide your project work. The handbook is also designed to be very practical, so that there are plenty of activities for you to do. The activities are there to help you make steady progress with essential work for your project and to help you develop your research skills: we strongly advise you complete them systematically.

\paragraph{Your working relation with your supervisor}  Your supervisor is your strongest study ally, a research expert who can guide and advise you on all aspects of your project, with whom you can discuss your research ideas, and who can assess that you are making sufficient progress at each point in your journey. It is essential that you develop a good working relationship with your supervisor, meet regularly and have an open and honest dialogue throughout your project.

\paragraph{Your self-drive and commitment} The course you are studying may provide you with some structure to help your progress your project, including, for instance formal assessment points. However, you will be in the driving seat most of the time. You must choose your topic and research problem, how to investigate it, and how to organise your research time in detail; it is also up to you to understand the academic standards required and to assess which research skills you must develop further to meet them. Above all, it is up to you to commit to a sustained effort for the duration of your project, which may be several months.

\paragraph{Continuous effort} Successful research requires continuity, so that you will need to set aside a sufficient and regular time for your research project every week, ensuring you keep making progress as you go along. Long breaks are incompatible with conducting research: while in your previous studies you may have been able to stop and start, and possibly cram lots of work around assignment deadlines, conducting research requires lots of time for reflection and for ideas to develop and mature, something you can't compress close to a deadline. Conducting research requires endurance, perseverance and continuous effort: it is a marathon, not a sprint!

\paragraph{Thinking and writing}  There is a crucial interaction between reading, thinking, and writing in research: reading informs your thinking; your thinking is what you try to express in your writing; your writing helps you make sense of what you have read, and hence of what you think, and informs more reading, thinking and writing. Because of this, while you will spend a lot of time reading and thinking, it is also essential that you write as you go along. The more regularly you write, the easier it will be for you to develop academic writing skills and the more critical your thinking will be.

\paragraph{Your dissertation}  It is very likely that your dissertation will be the only way your research is assessed. To be successful, your dissertation must demonstrate that you have mastered a wide range of research skills and can communicate your academic research effectively in writing. In fact, this is usually more important than any feature your proposed solution to your research problem might have. At Masters level, that you `solve' your research problem may not even be necessary! What matters most is your scholarly and critical attitude to each element of your research and your grasp of what academic research entails as demonstrated by your written dissertation.

\paragraph{Making good use of your study support}  Last but not least, it is important that you assess your progress as you go along, and make the most of the support which is provided to you by your supervisor, and any other adviser on your course. There will be times when you will find working on your project very challenging and may lose confidence in your ability to complete it. Those are the times when it is going to be particularly important for you to reach out and ask for extra help, even if your first instinct may be to hide. All researchers experience such feelings at one time or another, so do not be discouraged: talk to an adviser and work through the difficulties you are having to overcome them.

\section{Framework Takeaways}

\begin{itemize}
\item the research process is the the process you undertake when conducting academic research; its many activities are deeply connected, so that the process is both iterative and incremental, and can be messy
\item the 5-stage framework is designed to help you plan and conduct your project.It is a practical framework, with plenty of activities and guidance to help your develop your research skills and perform essential research tasks to complete your project
\item you can use the guidance provided to map the 5 stages of the framework to your project timeline 
\item following the framework will help you succeed, but other factors matter too (see Section~\ref{sect:successFactors}).
