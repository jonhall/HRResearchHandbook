\ReportIntroduction*!!--
	& At this stage you should be able to give an introduction to your research topic and its wider context as your Introduction. This can now include an introduction to your research in its broader context as background, and your justification for your research in terms of your context of application	\cref{stage1introduction}
\\

%%2-\ReportLitRev---
\ReportLitRev*!!
	& Create sections for your review of the literature you have read (as analysis), and for your critical summary (as synthesis). Your synthesis will include key trends, ideas and possible knowledge gaps. Most of your citations should typically be academic in nature. This will not be a complete draft as yet – many references could still be missing, to be added in later stages; these references that remain to be read should be captured in your progress tracking appendix (described below) and added to as other papers come to light \cref{stage1litrev}
\\

%%3-\ReportResearchDef----
\ReportResearchDef****
	& Reformulation and of problem statement, aim and objectives and potential knowledge contribution based on your increased understanding from deeper engagement with the literature \cref{stage1resdef}

	
	The problem statement is your reformulation of problem statement based on your increased understanding from deeper engagement with the literature \cref{stage1problemstatement}

The aim can be broken down into a few research objectives (\cref{stage1objectives}
