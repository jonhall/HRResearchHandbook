	abstract = {Abstract  Recent analyses of organizational change suggest a growing concern with the tempo of change, understood as the characteristic rate, rhythm, or pattern of work or activity. Episodic change is contrasted with continuous change on the basis of implied metaphors of organizing, analytic frameworks, ideal organizations, intervention theories, and roles for change agents. Episodic change follows the sequence unfreeze-transition-refreeze, whereas continuous change follows the sequence freeze-rebalance-unfreeze. Conceptualizations of inertia are seen to underlie the choice to view change as episodic or continuous.},

	year = {2021},
	abstract = {It is a well-known result by G{\"o}del in 1933 that the Intuitionistic Logic can be embedded into a system which is essentially equivalent to the modal logic S4. This can be considered to be an attempt to provide a provability semantics to the Intuitionistic Logic. This work had caused some problems: the exact arithmetical meaning of the Intuitionistic Logic and S4, the exact axiomatization of formal provability in formal arithmetic and the standard model of arithmetic. These days the arithmetical interpretation has been extended and generalized to epistemological interpretation for various modal logics, which resulted in various systems of Justification Logic. In Part I (Chapters 2-4) of this dissertation, we are concerned with logical system on provability and Justification Logic. A resource logic called Linear Logic LL is considered to be a refinement of S4 with explicit distinction of the two fragments: resource-conscious and modal fragments. The embedding result of the Intuitionistic Logic to LL still holds and the former is provided a resource semantics via LL. In Part II (Chapters 5-7), we study variations of LL and relationship between LL and Justification Logic. In Chapter 2, we report the new technique to realize a wide range of modal logics (epistemic logics) in justification logics. This method is modular and uniform for that range of modal logics. In Chapter 3, we propose a proof system for a basic logic known as the logic of provability in true arithmetic. The logic is basic and fundamental though a decent proof theory had not been explored for the logic. We offer the cut-elimination and some consequences of it: Craig interpolation theorem and definability theorem, and a proof-theoretic proof of the equivalence of the system and the well known system GL with respect to G\"{o}del sentences. In Chapter 4, we propose a generalization of the notion of constructive falsity proposed by Artemov 2019. Then, we completely characterize the closed sentences of Peano Arithmetic. Moreover, we locate Rosser sentences, constructive liar sentences and Reflection principles in the hierarchy of the generalized constructive falsity. In Chapter 5, we extend the meaning the modality of linear logic of the inexhaustibility of a proposition to mean additionally common resources sharable among agents in a setting of multi-agent system. Then, we give an extension of linear logic with such a modality using the tool of hypersequent calculus, and show the cut-elimination. We also prove decidability and realizability in terms of justification logic. In Chapter 6, we consider another extension of modality of linear logic where modal formulas s : A mean 'if s is available, A holds', called 'Linear Logic with explicit resources'. Then the usual modality is a special case of the empty resources. We show the cut-elimination and a type of realization theorem of linear logic to the pure fragment, that is, the subsystem of the extension without the original modality. In Chapter 7, we propose a bimodal substructural logic where one modality is the one in Linear Logic and the other is S4 modality which does not satisfy structural rules. We prove the cut-elimination and the realization theorem via the justification counterpart with two sorts of terms. Also, we consider the subsystem which lacks structural rules at all and establish that there occur no self-referentiality of constant specification of proofs. In Chapter 8, we close this thesis.},

	abstract = {Choosing the right architectural style and implementing it can save capital and human resources in a business environment. However, dealing with software architecture usually leads to more questions, such as the alternative patterns, what we should expect after adoption, and the negative aspects of this pattern. The difficulty of this process incentivizes teams to consider how to adopt particular mechanisms carefully. Nevertheless, each business has diverse needs. Thus, with an evergrowing rate of microservice patterns, this only leads to more confusion. This paper attempts to map microservice patterns based on specific metrics, including maintainability and scalability, efficiency, coupling, complexity. The right combination of patterns helps us build more loosely coupled, safer, more maintainable, and scalable services. This paper analyzes a case study for Researchable, aiming to maximize the maintainability of their application. The findings suggest the API gateway, asynchronous messaging, and database per service patterns contributed to a more maintainable architecture.},

	abstract = {Design practice is intrinsically about change and changing the world. Over the past two decades several new areas have emerged within design, such as service design, design thinking, speculative design, transition design and social design. What constitutes a desirable design outcome has also evolved. New design processes exist to enable those outcomes, and broader, more diverse communities often contribute to collective changemaking. Despite this, we still have a fragmented understanding of how to use design to create change, with a limited number of frameworks to guide its implementation in public and private settings. This article provides a brief overview of the recent developments in and through design that relate to how and why the usage of design has changed and how we design change. I look at the products, processes, and people related to change in design, and how design practice has fostered new roles in the field. In depth interviews with expert designers, and their insights about these roles, have been used to open up the discussion of what questions designers are aiming to define and answer, with whom, and how.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Many organisational problems are addressed through change and re-engineering of existing Information Systems rather than radical new design. In the face of up to 70\% IT project failure, devising effective ways to tackle this type of change remains an open challenge. The paper discusses the motivation, theoretical foundation, characteristics and evaluation of a novel framework - referred to as \POED{}, which is rooted in design and engineering and is aimed at providing systematic support for representing, structuring and exploring change problems of socio- technical nature. We generalise an existing theory of greenfield design as problem solving for application to change problems, using a design science research methodology. From a theoretical perspective \POED{} is a subset of its parent framework, allowing the seamless integration of greenfield and brownfield design to tackle change problems. Its initial case study evaluation, consisting in its application to a real-world change problem of realistic complexity, shows that \POED{} allows the systematic analysis of change problems, leading to clearer understanding and more informed decision making.},

	abstract = {In order to react to an increasing global competition on the one hand and an increasing demand for individual products on the other hand, product platforms became a well-established design concept for developing product families. By using the principle of modularization companies are able to achieve synergies within development and production and at the same time offer a wide variety of products. Therefore, approaches and methods for the initial setup of modular product architectures are well covered in the scientific literature. Nevertheless, a lack of research can be identified for the sustainable maintenance and continuous development of product platforms. Accordingly, most companies do not have a structured release management for the systematic introduction of technical changes and modified modules of physical products. In order to preserve the success of an implemented product platform, it is mandatory to plan the introduction of changes. In this paper, a new method is introduced for synchronizing the lifecycle of modules with the lifecycle of the respective platform products. The goal of this approach is to maximize the number of technical changes which can be implemented into products of an existing modular product platform at a certain time while minimizing development costs as well as changing efforts within production. At the end strategies are shown how to release physically changed modules into different product lines of a modular product platform.},

To this end,conceptual ideas such as Boland and Collopy's `managing as designing' haveaimed at exploring how `design thinking' can inform managers and the workdone in organizational contexts. However, these concepts tend to bediscussed theoretically with little grounding in empirical studies of practicethat might inform managing according to a `design thinking' approach. In thispaper we look at one attempt at facilitating organizational change through`design thinking'. The context is the design of a new building for the UTSBusiness School, Sydney by architect Frank Gehry. User participation wasapplied to engage stakeholders in ways that would produce valuable input formanagers as well as architects. We consider how architectural design andorganizational change are constructed and accomplished and to what extentthe manager's approach can be considered `design thinking'. Our findingssuggest that while `design thinking' may be one approach to managingcomplex change processes, a deeper engagement between designers,managers and users is needed.}}

	abstract = {This paper uses a business model framework to analyze the main limitations of Apple Inc. post-2003, a significant turning point in the company's history. As such, we move beyond an exclusive focus on what makes Apple unique or different by evaluating the mundane and out-dated elements of its business model. To do so, we examine the end-to-end supply chain, from source to store, to present a more holistic evaluation of the Apple business model. Drawing on the existing literature, we argue that the quintessential element of the Apple business model is its ability to `own the consumer'. In short, the Apple business model is designed to drive consumers into its ecosystem and then hold them there, which has been hugely successful to date and has allowed Apple to wield enormous power in the end-to-end supply chain. We demonstrate this through a detailed evaluation of Apple's physical and content supply chains and its retailing strategy. Moreover, we find that the very business processes that enable unparalleled corporate control bring with them new problems that Apple has thus far been unable, or unwilling, to adequately address.},

This paper offers the perspective that Netflix has survived a planned process of creatively designed destruction to renew its long-term strategy as it leads the video rental industry into the emerging world of on-demand streaming content. Drawing on the construct of ethical anarchy by Hurst (2002, 2012), as well as contributions from Morgan (2006, 2011), Jaworski (2011), and Argyris (2002), this research builds upon the concept of organisational renewal and sustainability through crisis and change, and argues that Netflix's actions have been strategic and purposeful, leveraging innovation and customer loyalty.},

	year = {2006},
	abstract = {Problem frames are a sound and convenient approach to requirements modeling. Nevertheless, they are far less popular than other less rigorous approaches. One reason is that they employ a notation that is neither very appealing nor easy to use. The problem frames notation is sufficiently different from other development languages --especially UML-- to create an \blockquote{impedance mismatch}: using problem frames to describe requirements does not help the transition to the design phase, makes it difficult for programmers to fully comprehend requirements, and does not favor traceability. As a consequence, problem frames are rarely adopted in software development processes employing UML as a design language. UML itself provides a linguistic support for requirements modeling, which however suffers from several limitations, especially as far as precision and formality are concerned.}}

	abstract = { This paper aims to propose a hierarchical, generative account of diatonic harmonic progressions and suggest a set of phrase-structure grammar rules. It argues that the structure of harmonic progressions exceeds the simplicity of the Markovian transition tables and proposes a set of rules to account for harmonic progressions with respect to key structure, functional and scale degree features as well as modulations. Harmonic structure is argued to be at least one subsystem in which Western tonal music exhibits recursion and hierarchical organization that may provide a link to overarching linguistic generative grammar on a structural and potentially cognitive level. },

- Quantum theory is starting to influence classical probability theory.
- There is a theory of chemical reaction networks that describes the interaction of molecules in a stochastic way.
- Stochastic Petri nets are a formalism used by computer scientists to describe randomly interacting entities.
- These formalisms are equivalent and are used in population biology and epidemiology models.
- The mathematics underlying these formalisms is similar to that used in quantum mechanics, but with probabilities instead of complex amplitudes.
- The analogy between quantum mechanics and stochastic mechanics is used to explain two major results in the theory of chemical reaction networks.
- The deficiency zero theorem gives conditions for the existence of equilibria in the approximation where the number of molecules is treated as varying continuously in a deterministic way.
- The Anderson-Craciun-Kurtz theorem gives conditions under which these equilibria continue to exist when the number of molecules is treated as discrete and varying in a random way.},

	annote = {AI This article discusses the criteria for the validation of qualitative research and proposes six concepts for monitoring the validation of phenomenological research in psychology. The article emphasizes the importance of coherence and adequacy of descriptions and interpretations in qualitative research. It also highlights the need for interpretations to arise from the data and be connected to the context and content of information collected from participants. The article acknowledges the dominant positivist epistemology in the natural sciences but argues for the value of qualitative research in producing valid knowledge.

The workflow for validation in qualitative research involves several key steps. First, there are general criteria that qualitative methods must meet, such as trustworthiness of the method, coherence of results, and transferability and application of results. Second, there are specific methodological criteria to monitor the quality control, including internal consistency and external consistency. Finally, there are six concepts that can be used to monitor the validation of phenomenological research within the context of qualitative research in psychology: intentionality, psychological phenomenological reduction, eidetic psychological analysis, syntheses of identification, phenomenon versus individual, and invariant structures.

- The article discusses the criteria for the validation of qualitative research in psychology.
- It presents a summary of concepts related to validation, reliability, and generalization in qualitative research.
- The article proposes six concepts that can be used to monitor the validation of phenomenological research in psychology.
- The concepts include intentionality, psychological phenomenological reduction, eidetic psychological analysis, syntheses of identification, phenomenon versus individual, and invariant structures.
- The article argues that there are general criteria that qualitative methods must meet, as well as specific methodological criteria for quality control.
- The article concludes by proposing a final definition to delimit the validation, reliability, and generalization of phenomenological research results.

The search results discuss various aspects of validation in qualitative research. Some key points to consider in validation include:

- The construction of conceptual networks and the applicability of results beyond the original context 
- The need for general criteria and specific methodological criteria to monitor quality control 
- The importance of validating interpretations and seeking consensus in qualitative research 
- The distinction between subjective accounts of experience and accounts of subjective experience 
- The use of psychological phenomenological reduction and the focus on the researcher in validating results 
- The potential for error and the need for continuous critical analysis in establishing objectivant acts},

	abstract = {Since Night of the Living Dead, zombies have been a frightening fixture on the pop-culture landscape, lumbering after hapless humans, slurping up brains and veins and whatever warm, fleshy matter they can clench in their rotting limbs. But what if they were real? What would happen if, tomorrow, corpses across the nation began springing up out of their graves and terrorizing the living? Employing hard science and solid police work - not to mention jaw-dropping (literally!) humor - Zombie CSU is the only guide available to staying alive and avoiding the undead. }}

	abstract = {Considerable progress has been made in the field of leadership in recent years. However, we argue that this is undermined by a strong residual commitment to an older set of ideas which have been repeatedly debunked but which nevertheless resolutely refuse to die. These, we term zombie leadership. Zombie leadership lives on not because it has empirical support but because it flatters and appeals to elites, to the leadership industrial complex that supports them, and also to the anxieties of ordinary people in a world seemingly beyond their control. It is propagated in everyday discourse surrounding leadership but also by the media, popular books, consultants, HR practices, policy makers, and academics who are adept at catering to the tastes of the powerful and telling them what they like to hear. This review paper outlines eight core claims (axioms) of zombie leadership. As well as isolating the problematic metatheory which holds these ideas together, we reflect on ways in which they might finally be laid to rest.},

The document discusses exoplanets and their potential for astrobiology. It outlines the methods for discovering exoplanets, presents current discoveries, and discusses future prospects. The focus is on habitability and the possibility of finding life on other planets. The document also provides a summary of properties of known exoplanetary systems.

- Exoplanets are primarily discovered through radial velocity measurements and transit photometry methods.
- The first exoplanet was discovered in 1995 orbiting the star 51 Pegasi.
- A catalogue of exoplanetary systems is regularly updated and can be found online.
- Detection methods are advancing rapidly, but sending a probe to confirm inhabited exoplanets is a distant prospect.

**Learning Objectives:** Define elements of a statistical investigation, understand the role of p-values and confidence intervals, recognize the importance of random sampling and random assignment, and critique statistical studies.

- Statistical Thinking module highlights key elements of a statistical investigation using four recent research studies.
- **Understanding basic ideas of statistics is crucial for making informed decisions and setting policies.**
- **Statistics allows us to systematically study phenomena of interest rather than relying on anecdote and intuition.**
- P-value, random sampling, random assignment, statistic significance, and generalizability are important concepts in statistical thinking.
- **Critiquing statistical studies involves analyzing research questions, sample selection, results, evidence strength, and study conclusions.**
- **Random sampling of 1,000 individuals may or may not be reasonable to draw conclusions about all U.S. adults, depending on various factors.**
- The study on coffee consumption and life expectancy raises questions about cause and effect relationships in research.
- Understanding concepts like confidence interval, distribution, parameter, and population are essential in statistical analysis.

Statistical thinking involves designing a study to collect data, analyzing patterns in the data, and drawing conclusions that go beyond the observed data. Random sampling is crucial for generalizing results, while random assignment is key for cause-and-effect conclusions. Probability models help assess random variation and estimate margin of error.

Statistical thinking involves issues such as generalizability, statistical significance, cause-and-effect conclusions, and random sampling and assignment.},

The document discusses the concept of reflexivity in qualitative research, focusing on two main inflections: positional reflexivity and textual reflexivity. It also reintroduces Garfinkel's ethnomethodological "constitutive reflexivity" as an alternative perspective. The text explores the diversity of reflexivity in the literature and its role in deconstructing the intersections of author, other, text, and world. The document includes references to various authors and their works on reflexivity and qualitative research.

- Reflexivity in qualitative research is a significant topic, with two main inflections: positional reflexivity and textual reflexivity.
- **Positional reflexivity** involves examining the influence of place, biography, self, and others on the analysis.
- **Textual reflexivity** focuses on disrupting the exercise of textual representation.
- The article discusses the concept of **constitutive reflexivity** in social science, particularly Garfinkel's ethnomethodological approach.
- **Reflexivity** is seen as a deconstructive exercise to understand the connections between author, text, and world.
- The literature on reflexivity is diverse, with various perspectives and interpretations.
- An example of constitutive reflexivity is analyzed through a videotaped sequence from a fifth-grade classroom.
- The rush of interest in qualitative research has led to a broad consensus on the importance of reflexivity.
- **Postmodern attachments** may influence the understanding of reflexivity, but it is suggested that there are commonalities with Enlightenment certainties.
- **Garfinkel's work** in ethnomethodology is referenced as an alternative perspective on reflexivity.

workflow: Reflexivity in qualitative research involves two main programs: positional reflexivity and textual reflexivity. Positional reflexivity focuses on examining how place, biography, self, and others shape the analytic exercise. Textual reflexivity, on the other hand, involves examining and disrupting the exercise of textual representation. Both programs aim to deconstruct and understand the intersections of author, other, text, and world in the research process.

issues: Reflexivity in qualitative research raises issues related to positional reflexivity and textual reflexivity, which focus on the impact of place, biography, self, and other on the analytic exercise, as well as the disruption of the exercise of textual representation. The discussion also introduces the concept of constitutive reflexivity, which dissolves binaries and representational language games into practical achievements of diverse settings and practices.},

These discussions help in understanding complex phenomena and generating new hypotheses for further study or practice. The focus group methodology involves group composition, managing group discussions, and analyzing results. It is compared to other qualitative methods like in-depth interviews and nominal group techniques. The focus group's advantage lies in its ability to quickly identify a full range of perspectives held by participants and to encourage interaction among participants to expand on their contributions.

- **Focus Groups** methodology is discussed in the document
- **Qualitative methods** permit the development of concepts to understand social phenomena
- **Focus groups** generate detailed data to formulate new hypotheses
- **In-depth interviews** and **nominal group technique** are compared to **focus groups**
- **Focus groups** allow for interaction between participants to explore complex phenomena
- **Focus groups** involve guided, interactional discussions on research topics

Workflow: - A focus group is a group of individuals selected by researchers to discuss a specific research topic from personal experience.
- Focus groups employ guided, interactional discussions to gather qualitative data.
- Focus groups are useful for eliciting information, answering research questions, and identifying a full range of perspectives.
- Focus groups should have between six and 10 participants who are strangers to each other.
- Group composition, management of group discussion, and analyzing results are important aspects of using focus groups in research.

Limitations:
- Focus groups may not be appropriate for investigating attitudes and experiences related to personal or sensitive topics.
- There may be doubts about the extent of individual participation influenced by the moderator and group dynamics.
- The process of analyzing focus group data can be time-consuming and require creative interpretation.

How to create:

- Focus groups should not be chosen based on individuals suggested by fellow group members.
- Existing knowledge of the subject should be inadequate to concentrate time and resources on the study's most pertinent variables.
- Anticipating subject loss, researchers should over-recruit participants by approximately 25\%.

The paper discusses methodological issues related to **using and analyzing focus groups** in social science research. It emphasizes the importance of **interactions within focus groups** and suggests that analysis should reflect these interactions. The paper also explores various **interactive features** such as dominance, construction of the Other, normative discourses, conflicts, and arguments within focus groups. Moderator strategies and analysis approaches that consider these interactions are considered.

- The paper discusses methodological issues related to **using and analyzing focus groups** in social science research.
- **Interactions within focus groups** are highlighted as a key aspect that should be reflected in data analysis.
- Various interactive features within focus groups, such as dominance, constructing the Other, normative discourses, conflicts, and arguments, are examined.
- The paper explores **possible moderator strategies** and analysis approaches to address these interactions.
- **Procedural changes** and improved moderator techniques are considered to manage tensions in focus group participation.
- The unique aspects of focus group methodology are emphasized to be related to the **interactions within the group context**.
- The analysis of focus group data should take into account the **interactive nature** of the data obtained.

Workflow: 

- Define focus groups as a controlled group discussion
- Consider group interaction as a key aspect of this methodology
- Address methodological issues such as dominant voices, constructing the Other, normative discourses, conflicts, and arguments within focus groups
- Analyze data by taking into account the interactions within the group context

Limitations

- Focus groups have limitations such as the emergence of socially acceptable opinions and dominant participants.
- These limitations can be viewed as possibilities for the method.
- Some weaknesses include certain topics being unsuitable for focus group research and the potential for views unlikely to emerge in this context.
- The use of focus groups as a quick data-gathering method may oversimplify the complexities of focus group behavior.
- Focus groups should be seen as a performance where opinions are constructed in social situations.

How to create:
- Define the purpose of the focus group
- Select participants with relevant experiences
- Plan discussion topics
- Choose a skilled moderator to guide the conversation
- Create a comfortable and open environment for participants to share their views

How to choose:
- Consider the purpose of the focus group and what information you want to gather.
- Define the target participants and ensure they represent diverse perspectives.
- Determine the number of participants based on the research objectives.
- Select a skilled moderator to guide the discussion effectively.
- Establish clear guidelines and objectives for the focus group session.},

	annote = {AI: Qualitative research designs, such as **focus groups**, are being used more frequently in health sciences to investigate areas like patients' views of healthcare services and clinicians' decision-making processes. **Focus groups** combine interviewing, participant observation, and group interaction, making them useful for uncovering data and ideas that may not come up in one-on-one questioning. 

To optimize data from focus groups, careful attention must be paid to the composition and number of groups, selection and training of the moderator, and development of the question route. The moderator plays a crucial role in facilitating group processes, establishing a permissive environment, maintaining focus, and controlling participant interactions. 

Key qualities of a moderator include empathy, positive regard, ability to create a purposeful introduction, and effective use of pauses and probes. There is debate in the literature about whether a focus group should be facilitated by a trained moderator or the researcher.

- Qualitative research designs are used in health sciences to investigate areas such as patients' views of healthcare services and clinicians' decision-making processes.
- **Focus groups** combine interviewing, participant observation, and group interaction to elicit data and ideas from participants.
- Careful attention must be paid to the composition and number of groups, selection and training of the moderator, and development of the question route to optimize data obtained from focus groups.
- The moderator's role is crucial in facilitating group processes, maintaining focus, and encouraging participation.
- Essential skills for a moderator include creating a purposeful introduction, establishing a permissive environment, and controlling the discussion without constraining it.
- **Empathy** and positive regard are important qualities for a moderator to express understanding and insight into participants' emotions and feelings.
- Debate exists on whether a trained moderator or researcher should facilitate a focus group.

Workflow:
- A focus group is a special form of group interview centered on a specific topic and facilitated by a moderator.
- The purpose of focus groups is to obtain data regarding ideas, attitudes, understanding, perceptions, vocabulary, and thinking patterns of the selected sample from the target population.
- Data are generated through the interaction between research participants.
- Focus groups combine interviewing, group interaction, and participant observation, making the data obtained particularly rich and complex.
- Factors to consider in the design and planning of focus group research include the composition and number of groups, selection and training of the moderator, and development of the question route.
- Careful attention must be paid to maximize the collection of high-quality data related to the research question.

Limitations:

- Random selection is not critical for focus groups
- Focus groups are not designed to achieve consensus
- Homogeneity of focus group participants is recommended
- Focus groups set out to explore diversity and determine the range of views

How to choose:
- Focus groups should employ purposive sampling, where participants are deliberately selected in relation to the research question.
- It is important to recruit participants who have experience and interest in the topic to be discussed.
- Homogeneity of focus group participants is recommended to maximize the comfort level of participants in expressing their views.
- Consider the composition and number of groups, as well as the selection and training of the moderator for successful focus group discussions.

How to create:- 
The purpose of a focus group is to obtain data regarding ideas, attitudes, understanding, and perceptions on a specific topic.
- Focus groups are facilitated by a moderator who guides the discussion.
- Participants should be selected based on their experience and interest in the topic, rather than through random selection.
- The ideal number of participants in a focus group depends on the type of questions and the characteristics of the group.
- Focus groups should be conducted in a series to identify trends across different groups.},

Documents are written records or figures produced as a by-product of the operation of an institution, firm, or department. They can be used directly for their factual content or indirectly to uncover what they reveal about the writer or as examples of a specific form of presentation. Documents can be in various forms such as words/text, pictures, or audio, and are stored on physical carriers like paper, stone, or microfiche.


Define a workflow for document analysis: 
- **Documentary sources** can include a variety of mediums such as papyrus, parchment, stone, tape, cassette, micro-film/fiche, and electronic formats.
- **Different types of documentary sources** include works of reference, government reports, statistical records, newspapers, periodicals, film, photographs, maps, sound and video recordings, interviews, museums, computerized records, and more.
- **Researchers** using documentary sources need to compile their own account of the procedures and methods used to compile the records for their study.
- **Selection and interpretation** of documentary sources are influenced by practical constraints, researchers' aims, and viewpoints.
- **Evaluation** of research based on documentary sources needs to consider how sources come into being, selection, and interpretation.
- **Understanding the nature of documents** and how they are compiled is essential for critiquing methodological procedures in document-based research.

what else should I think about in analysing documents?
- Sources have to be interpreted, not just consulted.
- Consider how sources came into being: by whom, under what circumstances, with what motives and assumptions, and how selected.
- Assess how sensibly the sources are interpreted in the research.
- Think about the form, medium, and mode of presentation of the sources.
- Evaluate statistical records and the assumptions made in collecting and presenting them.
- Consider whether the source provides recommendations, ideals, or factual information.
- Examine whether the source is directed towards a specific audience or purpose.
- Determine whether the researcher made use of primary or secondary sources and if the choice was appropriate.

in detail, which tools are used to analyse documents? 
- Researchers use documentary sources to collect and analyze evidence.
- Some tools used for analyzing documents include direct use (interrogation of records for their factual content), indirect use (interrogation of records for their unwitting content), and form (mode of presentation such as words/text, pictures, audio).
- Researchers can also distinguish between primary sources (documents providing raw data) and secondary sources (documents providing information about primary sources).

Self-reflective journaling is suggested as an assessment method in dance technique classes. The use of self-reflection integrates assessment into the learning process, focusing on personal goal setting. Teacher reflection prompts should be guided, repeated regularly, sincere, nonjudgmental, and conversational. General prompts stimulate thinking about broader class goals, while specific prompts focus on particular skills or concepts. Journal entries help students reconstruct their thoughts from class, assess understanding, show growth over time, and develop cognitive skills. The self-reflective journal can serve as an effective summative assessment tool when compared to student and teacher goals for the semester.

	abstract = {Donald Reinhardt discovered and cataloged different brass embouchure types and established the correlation of these types to different dental structures. He published the results of his research in Donald S. Reinhardt's Pivot System for Trumpet in 1942 and The Encyclopedia of the Pivot System in 1973. Two problems are evident with Reinhardt's published research. The first problem arises with his attempt to describe a phenomenon that takes place at a brass player's embouchure---specifically, the embouchure mechanics involved in ascending and descending on a brass instrument. He coined the term \enquote{pivot,} which led to many misconceptions and misunderstandings, and frequently resulted in a dismissal of Reinhardt's \enquote{system} and a general disregard for his research---including his valuable embouchure classifications. A solution to the problem with \enquote{pivot} is the substitution of the term \enquote{track,} a much more accurate term. The central incisors of both the top and bottom teeth form a type of track, and it is on this track that the vertical pushing and puffing of the lips and mouthpiece occur as a unit. The second problem with Reinhardt's work has to do with the organization of his diagrams of basic dental structures and the mouthpiece placements associated with each. Donald S. Reinhardt's Pivot System for Trumpet contains diagrams that depict various aspects of the different embouchure classifications, but cross-referencing is necessary and sometimes difficult for the reader. Reinhardt's lengthy second work, The Encyclopedia of the Pivot System, has a thorough text, but the diagrams lack the size and detail needed for full comprehension. The present study provides a solution to these problems by providing detailed photographs of the predominant dental structures and of actual trumpet players exhibiting different embouchure types. The photographs clarify Reinhardt's work and provide new insights into understanding the brass embouchure. They illustrate that dental bite generally affects mouthpiece placement but does not necessarily affect tracking. When coupled with related research, the photographs show that the position of the central and lateral incisors affects both mouthpiece placement and tracking.},

The study investigates four types of validation methods: classical and Bayesian hypothesis testing, a reliability-based method, and an area metric-based method. The paper outlines the formulations and implementation details for these methods and discusses their application in fully characterized and partially characterized validation experiments. The results show that Bayesian hypothesis testing, the reliability-based method, and the area metric-based method can account for directional bias in model predictions. The paper also highlights the mathematical relationship between the Bayes factor metric and the p-value metric under specific conditions. Numerical studies are conducted to apply these validation methods to gas damping prediction for RF MEMS switches.

- This paper develops new insights into quantitative methods for the validation of computational model prediction.
- Four types of methods are investigated: classical and Bayesian hypothesis testing, a reliability-based method, and an area metric-based method.
- Traditional Bayesian hypothesis testing is extended based on interval hypotheses on distribution parameters and equality hypotheses on probability distributions.
- Two types of validation experiments are considered: fully characterized and partially characterized.
- Bayesian hypothesis testing can minimize the risk in model selection by properly choosing the model acceptance threshold.
- Bayesian interval hypothesis testing, the reliability-based method, and the area metric-based method can account for directional bias in model predictions.
- The Bayes factor metric in Bayesian equality hypothesis testing and the reliability-based metric can be mathematically related to the p-value metric in classical hypothesis testing.
- Numerical studies are conducted to apply the validation methods to gas damping prediction for radio frequency (RF) microelectromechanical system (MEMS) switches.
- Model validation is the process of determining the accuracy of a model from the perspective of its intended use.
- Qualitative validation methods such as graphical comparisons are widely used, but quantitative methods are needed to account for errors and uncertainty.
- The model of interest is a general polynomial chaos (gPC) surrogate model constructed based on expensive runs of a physics-based simulation model.
- Validation data are collected from fully characterized experiments.
- Keywords: model validation, hypothesis testing, Bayesian statistics, reliability, MEMS.},

Joseph Maxwell defines five types of understanding and validity commonly used in qualitative research: descriptive validity, interpretive validity, theoretical validity, generalizability, and evaluative validity. These types of validity address different issues of understanding and can help researchers consider threats to validity and how to address them. Validity is an important issue in qualitative research because if the results are not valid, then the policies, programs, or predictions based on these studies cannot be relied on. Proponents of quantitative and experimental approaches have criticized the absence of "standard" means of assuring validity in qualitative research.

detailed defn.: Validity refers to the extent to which a research study accurately measures or assesses what it intends to measure or assess. In qualitative research, there are different types of validity that are relevant. These include descriptive validity, interpretive validity, theoretical validity, generalizability, and evaluative validity. Descriptive validity refers to the accuracy and completeness of the description of a phenomenon. Interpretive validity relates to the understanding and interpretation of the data. Theoretical validity involves the extent to which the findings align with existing theories. Generalizability pertains to the applicability of the findings to a broader population or context. Evaluative validity refers to the assessment of the value or worth of the research.

- Qualitative researchers rely on various types of validity in their research process.
- The author defines five types of understanding and validity commonly used in qualitative research: descriptive validity, interpretive validity, theoretical validity, generalizability, and evaluative validity.
- The proposed typology serves as a checklist for threats to validity and a framework for addressing these threats.
- Validity has been a key issue in debates over the legitimacy of qualitative research.
- Existing categories of validity are based on positivist assumptions underlying quantitative and experimental research.
- The issue of validity in qualitative research has gained attention in recent years.
- If qualitative studies cannot consistently produce valid results, then policies, programs, or predictions based on these studies cannot be relied on.
- Proponents of quantitative and experimental approaches have criticized the absence of "standard" means of assuring validity.
- The author discusses the implications of the proposed typology as a useful checklist and framework for addressing threats to validity.
- The author also references other works that discuss validity in qualitative research.

The validity of research is evaluated based on the statements, inferences, or conclusions drawn from its results (p. 37). Research purposes in social psychology can be categorized into three broad categories: demonstration, causation, and explanation (p. 1). Demonstration research aims to establish the existence of a phenomenon or relationship, often describing the state of the world or assessing the degree of relationship between conditions (p. 1). The design and conduct of a study impact the validity of the conclusions drawn from its results (p. 1).

Validity refers to the extent to which a study or research findings accurately measure or represent what they are intended to measure or represent. It is the degree to which the conclusions drawn from a study can be considered reliable and trustworthy. Validity can be evaluated in terms of different aspects, such as internal validity, external validity, and construct validity. Internal validity refers to the extent to which a causal relationship between variables can be established within the context of a specific study. External validity refers to the generalizability of the findings to different participants, settings, and methods. Construct validity refers to the extent to which the study's methods and operations accurately represent the theoretical constructs and processes they are meant to represent.

- Validity refers to the approximation of truth or falsity of propositions in empirical research.
- The validity of research is evaluated based on the statements, inferences, or conclusions drawn from the results.
- The goals of empirical research in social psychology can be categorized into three categories: demonstration, causation, and explanation.
- Demonstration research aims to establish the existence of a phenomenon or relationship.
- Descriptive research is often conducted in field settings but can also be done in controlled laboratory settings.

- Validity and reliability increase transparency and decrease opportunities for researcher bias in qualitative research.
- Validity is represented by the truthfulness of findings, while reliability is referred to as the stability of findings.
- The research methodology chapter should present reliability and validity in a concise but precise manner.
- Reliability and validity are appropriate concepts for introducing a remarkable setting in research.
- The research aims to review the reliability and validity, and threats to them, in some detail.

(detaild defn): Validity refers to the truthfulness and accuracy of the results obtained from a measurement instrument or research study. It ensures that the instrument or study is measuring what it claims to measure. Reliability, on the other hand, refers to the consistency and stability of the results obtained from a measurement instrument or research study. It ensures that the instrument or study produces consistent results over time and across different circumstances. Validity and reliability are important concepts in research methodology as they help ensure the integrity and quality of the data and results obtained.},

Bias in research is a significant concern in the field of evidence-based medicine. Plastic surgeons must critically interpret study results and evaluate the rigor of study design to identify and avoid bias. Bias can occur in various stages of research, including planning, data collection, analysis, and publication. Understanding different types of bias and how they can be avoided is crucial for practicing evidence-based medicine.

(Outside of medicine): Bias in research refers to any tendency that prevents unbiased consideration of a question. It can occur at any phase of research, including study design, data collection, data analysis, and publication. Bias can arise from various sources such as flawed study design, selection bias, interviewer bias, recall bias, and citation bias. It is important for readers to be aware of bias in research in order to critically evaluate the scientific literature and make informed decisions.

(Outside of medicine): Bias is defined as any tendency which prevents unprejudiced consideration of a question. In research, bias occurs when systematic error is introduced into sampling or testing by selecting or encouraging one outcome or answer over others. Bias can occur at any phase of research, including study design, data collection, data analysis, and publication.

- Bias can occur in the planning, data collection, analysis, and publication phases of research.
- Understanding research bias allows readers to critically and independently review the scientific literature and avoid treatments which are suboptimal or potentially harmful.
- Plastic surgeons must critically interpret study results and evaluate the rigor of study design and identify study biases.
- Chance and confounding can be quantified and/or eliminated through proper study design and data analysis.
- Only the most rigorously conducted trials can completely exclude bias as an alternate explanation for an association.
- Different types of bias include pre-trial bias, selection bias, channeling bias, interviewer bias, chronology bias, recall bias, transfer bias, exposure misclassification, outcome misclassification, performance bias, citation bias, and confounding.
- To avoid bias, clearly define risk and outcome, use objective or validated methods, consider cluster stratification, register trials with accepted clinical trials registries, check registries for similar unpublished or in-progress trials prior to publication, and control known confounders through study design or data analysis.
- The quality of published research in plastic surgery has been noted to be poor, but there has been a gradual trend toward higher level study designs.
- Evidence-based medicine is an essential part of medical school curriculum, but plastic surgeons have limited ability to practice it.
- The manuscript will undergo copyediting, typesetting, and review before it is published in its final citable form.},

	annote = {AI summary: Accusations of bias in social research are common but the term `bias' is ambiguous and can refer to different things. It can refer to the adoption of a particular perspective or to systematic error. The use of `bias' to refer to systematic error relies on concepts such as `truth' and `objectivity' which have been questioned. However, the abandonment of a foundationalist conception of science does not invalidate the concept of bias, as it forms an essential framework for research as a social practice.

(bias outside): Bias is a recurrent issue in social and psychological sciences, and it can take various forms of error. Accusations of bias have been made in major public events, such as attacks on certain theories and critiques of research. The term 'bias' has been used in different ways in the literature of social research methodology, and its meaning has not been given much attention. There are attempts outside of research communities, including by funders and governments, to define the goal of research in terms other than the pursuit of knowledge, which poses a threat to research. It is necessary to rethink the issues surrounding truth, objectivity, and bias in social research, as neither foundationalism nor radical alternatives provide an adequate basis for understanding bias.

(detailed definition) Bias can be defined in several different ways. It can refer to systematic, culpable, motivated error, or it can encompass all kinds of culpable, systematic error, or even all kinds of systematic error. However, a preferred definition of bias is systematic and culpable error; systematic error that the researcher should have been able to recognize and minimize. This definition is based on the judgment of either the researcher themselves or others.

- The term 'bias' in social research is ambiguous and can refer to adopting a particular perspective or to systematic error. 
- The use of 'bias' to refer to systematic error relies on foundationalist epistemological assumptions that have been discredited. 
- Abandonment of a foundationalist conception of science has implications for the meaning of 'bias' and its associated concepts. 
- Accusations of bias are not uncommon in the social sciences. 
- Bias can derive from a researcher's conscious or unconscious tendency to produce data or interpret them in a way that aligns with their commitments. 
- The concept of bias is defensible and forms an essential framework for research as a social practice. 
- The document includes references to various books and articles on the topic of bias and social research. 
- The document also mentions the importance of validity in qualitative research. 
- The document discusses the role of truth, objectivity, and epistemological assumptions in understanding bias. 
- The document references the Positivist Dispute in German Sociology and the Comparative Method as sources of further reading.},

Bias refers to the systematic error or deviation from the truth in a study that results in incorrect estimates or conclusions. It can be introduced at various stages of the research process, including study design, subject selection, measurement, and analysis. There are several types of bias, including confounding bias, selection bias, and information bias. It is important for researchers to recognize and understand potential biases that may threaten the validity of their study and take appropriate measures to minimize or adjust for bias.

(Bias in general research): Bias in general research refers to the presence of systematic error in a study, which means that the estimate of association obtained from a biased study differs systematically from the true association in the source population of the study. Bias can be introduced into a study through various factors, including the exposure of patients to treatments, the inclusion of patients in the study, and the assessment and measurement of variables. It is important for researchers to recognize and understand potential biases in order to conduct methodologically sound research projects. Methods to address bias include changes in study design, subject selection, or measurement; adjustment for the effects of bias during analysis; or acknowledging the presence of bias and examining its effect on the study's results.

There are two types of biases: random biases, which occur due to sampling variability or measurement precision, and systematic biases, which produce consistently false patterns of differences. Common categories of bias include selection biases and measurement biases. Measurement biases can include instrument bias, insensitive measure bias, expectation bias, recall or memory bias, attention bias, and verification or work-up bias. Bias is a universal problem in research studies and can distort data. No study design is exempt from bias.

Bias refers to systematic error that can affect scientific investigations and distort the measurement process. It can occur in various forms and can impact the validity of research studies. There are different types of biases, including selection biases, measurement biases, and intervention biases. Selection biases occur when the groups being compared are different, while measurement biases involve systematic errors in collecting relevant data. Intervention biases are associated with differences in how the treatment or intervention was carried out. Some common types of biases include instrument bias, volunteer or referral bias, expectation bias, recall or memory bias, attention bias, and verification or work-up bias. Random biases and systematic biases are the two main categories of biases that can affect research studies. Random biases occur due to sampling variability or measurement precision, while systematic biases are reproducible errors that produce consistently false patterns of differences between observed and true values. Randomization is a method commonly used to reduce bias in research studies.

Parliament(s) need to identify needs, allocate powers and responsibilities to regulatory agencies, while an independent body develops and maintains detailed obligations.

\begin{itemize}
\item  The development and maintenance of detailed obligations should be delegated to an independent body.
\item  Various forms of regulatory schemes are considered.
\item  The precautionary principle is mentioned.
\item  The establishment of a legislated framework with key features is suggested.

It argues that transparency requirements should include understandable explanations of these biases that are feasible for producers. It also highlights the importance of considering the usefulness of explanations in specific legal contexts.

\begin{itemize}
\item  There are autonomous AI applications that can act without oversight. They are liable to reflect bias from input. This raises a risk, the same that exists from humans working with boased data.
\item  The biases and risks associated with AI algorithms might be (partially) addressed through regulation and oversight.
\item  Transparency requirements for algorithms should produce understandable explanations, from which bias can be dedcued.
\item  Transparency and explanation of AI algorithms (or the relationship between input and output) can help address these concerns.
\item  The issue of accountability and liability for AI algorithms is also discussed.
\item  The usefulness of explanations in specific legal contexts should be considered.
\item  If acceptibility is an issue, a balance between transparency and system performance in AI decision-making may be needed.

It discusses the combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches in data collection, analysis, and interpretation. The document provides references to other studies and books related to the topic.

Validity refers to the extent to which a research study measures what it intends to measure and accurately reflects the concept or phenomenon under investigation. It is a crucial aspect of research quality and involves establishing the credibility, trustworthiness, and accuracy of the findings. Validity can be assessed in different ways, including internal validity, external validity, and construct validity. Internal validity refers to the extent to which the study design and procedures ensure that the observed effects are actually caused by the independent variable. External validity refers to the generalizability of the findings to other populations, settings, and time periods. Construct validity refers to the extent to which the measures used in the study accurately capture the underlying constructs or concepts of interest.

Threats to validity in mixed methods research include:
- Mismatch between quantitative and qualitative samples
- Imbalance between insider's and outsider's views
- Insufficient knowledge of research question, theory, hypotheses, statistical tests, and analysis
- Occurrence of unrelated events or conditions during data collection
- Insufficient or biased knowledge of earlier studies and theories
- Lack of descriptive validity of settings and events during data analysis and interpretation
- Population, time, and environmental validity in quantitative research
- Lack of cognitive and empathy training of researchers
- Value or ideologically based conflicts in collaboration between quantitative and qualitative researchers
- Difficulty in persuading consumers to value the meta-inferences from both qualitative and quantitative findings.},

It is essentially a strategy that will aid in the elimination of bias and allow the dismissal of plausible rival explanations such that a truthful proposition about some social phenomenon can be made (Campbell & Fiske, 1959; Denzin, 1978; Webb, Campbell, Schwartz, & Sechrest, 1966).''

AI summary: Triangulation is a strategy used to increase the validity of research findings. It involves using multiple data sources and methods to arrive at a singular proposition about the phenomenon being studied. However, this expectation is unrealistic as triangulation often leads to convergent, inconsistent, and contradictory evidence. Triangulation helps researchers and evaluators withstand critique by colleagues and enhances the credibility of their work. It is important to explain all outcomes of triangulation, not just the inconsistent and contradictory ones. Triangulation can be achieved through data triangulation, investigator triangulation, and methodological triangulation. The use of triangulation improves research practice by eliminating bias and allowing for the dismissal of rival explanations, leading to more truthful propositions about social phenomena.

risks: Triangulation can result in inconsistent or contradictory findings, which may pose risks to the validity of research or evaluation findings. It is important to understand that triangulation does not guarantee convergence on a single proposition about a social phenomenon. Instead, it provides a rich and complex picture that requires careful interpretation and explanation by the researcher. Triangulation should be used cautiously and researchers should be prepared to explain and make sense of the various outcomes it may produce.

It compares the theoretical development of the concept of validity with the methodology adopted in validity studies over time. Three Swedish research projects aiming to validate instruments used for selection to higher education are described as examples of contemporary practice. The conclusions from these comparisons are that practices seem to have followed theory when it comes to how the validity research programs have been designed, but not when it comes to how they then were carried out in practice. [2, 15-18]

Validity is a concept that has evolved over time and has become more complex. Initially, validity was considered to be a fixed property of a test, with adequate correlations between test scores and an external criterion being seen as evidence of validity. However, the definition of validity expanded to include different types of validity related to the purpose of the test. These types include content validity, criterion-related validity, and construct validity. Content validity is used for tests that describe an individual's performance on a defined subject, criterion-related validity is used for tests that predict future performance, and construct validity is used to make inferences about psychological traits. Messick's model introduced the idea of social consequences of measurement outcomes as an important aspect of validity. The introduction of social consequences raised debates about the feasibility and inclusion of consequences in the validity framework. Kane's argumentative approach to validity emphasizes the practical feasibility and provides guidance on how to allocate research efforts and gauge the validation process. The integration of validity evidence and the need for guidance on prioritizing validity questions are also discussed.

- The paper compares the theoretical development of validity with the methodology adopted in validity studies over time.

Computerized data analysis packages can also enhance reliability. It is important to balance standardization with maintaining the context and meaning of the data.

detailed definition of validity: Validity refers to the extent to which a measure accurately represents the concept it claims to measure. It is concerned with the relevance and representativeness of the items or questions in a study. There are different levels of validity, including content validity, criterion-related validity, and construct validity. Content validity focuses on the relevance and representativeness of individual items, while criterion-related validity involves comparing a measure to other similar validated measures. Construct validity examines the underlying theoretical concepts and constructs being measured. Validity is important in ensuring that research findings are accurate and trustworthy.

detailed definition of reliability: Reliability refers to the trustworthiness and consistency of the procedures and data generated in research. It is concerned with the extent to which the results of a study or measure are repeatable in different circumstances. Reliability can be demonstrated through methods such as inter-rater reliability, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency.

- Reliability and validity are ways to demonstrate the rigour and trustworthiness of quantitative and qualitative research.
- Reliability refers to the consistency and stability of research findings.
- Validity refers to the accuracy and truthfulness of research findings.
- Qualitative content analysis is a reliable approach to handling data.
- Content validity is concerned with the relevance and representativeness of items in a questionnaire.
- Criterion-related validity is established when a tool can be compared to other similar validated measures.
- The pursuit of truth and the limitation of error are the defining characteristics of science.
- Science is an attitude of mind rather than a set of procedures.
- The synthesis of art and science is lived by the nurse in the nursing act.},

Abstract: This article advances a simple conception of test validity: A test is valid for measuring an attribute if (a) the attribute exists and (b) variations in the attribute causally produce variation in the measurement outcomes. This conception is shown to diverge from current validity theory in several respects. In particular, the emphasis in the proposed conception is on ontology, reference, and causality, whereas current validity theory focuses on epistemology, meaning, and correlation. ***It is argued that the proposed conception is not only simpler but also theoretically superior to the position taken in the existing literature.***  Further, it has clear theoretical and practical implications for validation research. Most important, validation research must not be directed at the relation between the measured attribute and other attributes but at the processes that convey the effect of the measured attribute on the test scores.

AI summary: This article presents a simple conception of test validity, stating that a test is valid for measuring an attribute if the attribute exists and variations in the attribute causally produce variation in the measurement outcomes. The proposed conception focuses on ontology, reference, and causality, rather than epistemology, meaning, and correlation, which is the emphasis in current validity theory. The article argues that the proposed conception is simpler and theoretically superior to the existing literature. It also highlights the importance of validation research focusing on the processes that convey the effect of the measured attribute on the test scores, rather than the relation between the measured attribute and other attributes.

There are different types of validity, including descriptive validity, interpretive validity, theoretical validity, generalizability, and evaluative validity. The choice between quantitative and qualitative research depends on the research question and the goals of the study. Quantitative research is suitable for verifying or testing existing theories, while qualitative research is more exploratory and seeks to understand new areas or experiences. It is important for the research community to accept that there are different ways to gain the truth and to use different sample sizes, while still ensuring validity.

Validity in qualitative research refers to the accuracy and credibility of the research findings. It encompasses several aspects, including descriptive validity (accuracy of the data and its representation), interpretive validity (reporting the participants' meaning of events), theoretical validity (addressing the researcher's theoretical constructions), generalizability (applicability of findings to similar groups), and evaluative validity (the overall quality and value of the research). Validity in qualitative research is different from validity in quantitative research, as it focuses on subjective, interpretive, and contextual data.

- The paper aims to review the concepts of validity in qualitative research.
- Sample size and validity are the most often queried aspects of qualitative research.
- Researchers have a choice between quantitative and qualitative research design.
- Quantitative research is appropriate for verifying or testing defined variables.
- Qualitative research is suitable for exploratory research or understanding the experience of a given situation.
- Different ways to gain the truth include using different sample sizes.
- The research community should put aside the debate on the validity of either paradigm and accept different ways to gain the truth.

From page 66:

Validity: the extent to which a concept is accurately measured in a quantitative study.
For example, a survey designed to explore depression but which actually measures anxiety would not be considered valid. 
1. Content validity: the extent to which an instrument covers the entire domain related to the variable, or construct it was designed to measure? 

2. Construct validity: the extent to which can draw inferences about test scores related to the concept being studied. There are three types of evidence that can be used to demonstrate a research instrument has construct validity:

Homogeneity---meaning that the instrument measures one construct.

Convergence---this occurs when the instrument measures concepts similar to that of other instruments. Although if there are no similar instruments available this will not be possible to do.

Theory evidence---this is evident when behaviour is similar to theoretical propositions of the construct measured in the instrument. For example, when an instrument measures anxiety, one would expect to see that participants who score high on the instrument for anxiety also demonstrate symptoms of anxiety in their day-to-day lives.


3. Crierion validity: A criterion is any other instrument that measures the same variable. The extent to which different instruments' measurements of the same variable are correlated. Criterion validity is measured in three ways:

Convergent validity---shows that an instrument is highly correlated with instruments measuring similar variables.

Divergent validity---shows that an instrument is poorly correlated to instruments that measure different variables. In this case, for example, there should be a low correlation between an instrument that measures motivation and one that measures self-efficacy.

Predictive validity---means that the instrument should have high correlations with future criterions.2  For example, a score of high self-efficacy related to performing a task should predict the likelihood a participant completing the task.




Reliability: the extent to which a research instrument consistently has the same results if it is used in the same situation on repeated occasions.

For example of [both] validity and reliability is an alarm clock that rings at 7:00 each morning, but is set for 6:30. It is very reliable (it consistently rings the same time each day), but is not valid (it is not ringing at the desired time). It's important to consider validity and reliability of the data collection tools (instruments) when either conducting or critiquing research. There are three major types of validity. These are described in table 1.

Types of validity:

Homogeneity (internal consistency)  the extent to which all the items on a sclae measure one construct. This is assessed using item-to-total correlation, split-half reliability, KuderRichardson coefficient and Cronbach's @. In split-half reliability, the results of a test, or instrument, are divided in half. Correlations are calculated comparing both halves. Strong correlations indicate high reliability, while weak correlations indicate the instrument may not be reliable. The Kuder-Richardson test is a more complicated version of the split-half test. In this process the average of all possible split half combinations is determined and a correlation between 0--1 is generated. This test is more accurate than the split-half test, but can only be completed on questions with two answers (eg, yes or no, 0 or 1).

Stability: the extent to which the results of an instrument repeatedly applied are consistent. Stability is tested using test--retest and parallel or alternate-form reliability testing. Test--retest reliability is assessed when an instrument is given to the same participants more than once under similar circumstances.

Equivalence: Consistency among responses of multiple users of an instrument, or among alternate forms of an instrument. Equivalence is assessed through inter-rater reliability. This test includes a process for qualitatively determining the level of agreement between two or more observers. A good example of the process used in assessing interrater reliability is the scores of judges for a skating competition. The level of consistency across all judges in the scores given to skating participants is the measure of inter-rater reliability. An example in research is when researchers are asked to give a score for the relevancy of each item on an instrument. Consistency in their scores relates to the level of inter-rater reliability of the instrument.


AI Summary: Validity and reliability are important considerations in quantitative research. Validity refers to the accuracy of measuring a concept, while reliability refers to the consistency of results. Content validity ensures that an instrument covers all the relevant content, while construct validity allows for inferences about test scores. Reliability can be assessed through measures such as item-to-total correlation, test-retest reliability, and parallel-form reliability. Criterion validity involves comparing an instrument to other measures of the same variable. Overall, nurses need to be able to critique quantitative research for its validity and reliability.

(consists of): Validity consists of three main components: convergent validity, divergent validity, and predictive validity. Convergent validity refers to the instrument's correlation with other instruments measuring similar variables. Divergent validity refers to the instrument's lack of correlation with instruments measuring different variables. Predictive validity refers to the instrument's ability to accurately predict future outcomes.

Convergent validity refers to the extent to which an instrument is highly correlated with other instruments that measure similar variables. It is a measure of how well an instrument captures the same construct as other instruments.

Divergent validity refers to the extent to which an instrument is poorly correlated with instruments that measure different variables. It demonstrates that the instrument is measuring a distinct and separate construct from other instruments.

Predictive validity refers to the extent to which an instrument or test can accurately predict future outcomes or behaviors. For example, if a test of self-efficacy is found to have high correlations with participants' successful completion of a task, it demonstrates predictive validity.

Validity refers to the accuracy with which a concept is measured, while reliability refers to the consistency of results obtained using an instrument. Validity can be assessed through content validity, construct validity, and criterion validity. Reliability can be assessed through homogeneity (internal consistency), stability, and equivalence. It is important to consider the validity and reliability of data collection tools when conducting or critiquing research.

 Research made simple Validity and reliability in quantitative studies E v i d 10.1136/eb-2015-102129 1School of Nursing, Laurentian University, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada 2Faculty of Health and Social Care, London South Bank University, London, UK Correspondence to: Dr Roberta Heale, School of Nursing, Laurentian University, Ramsey Lake Road, Sudbury, Ontario, Canada P3E2C6; rheale@laurentian.ca Roberta Heale,1 Alison Twycross2 Evidence-based practice includes, in part, implementation of the findings of well-conducted quality research studies. So being able to critique quantitative research is an important skill for nurses. Consideration must be given not only to the results of the study but also the rigour of the research. Rigour refers to the extent to which the researchers worked to enhance the quality of the studies. In quantitative research, this is achieved through measurement of the validity and reliability.1 Validity Validity is defined as the extent to which a concept is accurately measured in a quantitative study.

 Test--retest reliability is assessed when an instrument is given to the same participants more than once under similar circumstances. A statistical comparison is made between participant's test scores for each of the times they have completed it. This provides an indication of the reliability of the instrument. Parallel-form reliability (or alternate-form reliability) is similar to test--retest reliability except that a different form of the original instrument is given to participants in subsequent tests. The domain, or concepts being tested are the same in both versions of the instrument but the wording of items is different.2 For an instrument to demonstrate stability there should be a high Evid Based Nurs July 2015 | volume 18 | number 3 | 67 Evid Based Nurs: first published as 10.1136/eb-2015-102129 on 15 May 2015. Downloaded from http://ebn.bmj.com/ on 20 November 2018 by guest. An example in research is when researchers are asked to give a score for the relevancy of each item on an instrument. Consistency in their scores relates to the level of inter-rater reliability of the instrument. Determining how rigorously the issues of reliability and validity have been addressed in a study is an essential component in the critique of research as well as influencing the decision about whether to implement of the study findings into nursing practice. In quantitative studies, rigour is determined through an evaluation of the validity and reliability of the tools or instruments utilised in the study. A good quality research study will provide evidence of how all these factors have been addressed. This will help you to assess the validity and reliability of the research and help you decide whether or not you should apply the findings in your area of clinical practice.},

This paper develops the concepts and methods of a process we will call " alignment of computational models" or " docking" for short. 	extbf{Alignment is needed to determine whether two models can produce the same results}, which in turn is the basis for critical experiments and for tests of whether one model can subsume another. We illustrate our concepts and methods using as a target a model of cultural transmission built by Axelrod. For comparison we use the Sugarscape model developed by Epstein and Axtell.

The two models differ in many ways and, to date, have been employed with quite different alms. The Axelrod model has been used principally for intensive experimentation with parameter variation, and includes only one mechanism. In contrast, the Sugarscape model has been used primarily to generate rich " artificial histories," scenarios that display stylized facts of interest, such as cultural differentiation d0ven by many different mechansims including resource availability, migration, trade, and combat.

The Sugarscape model was modified so as to reproduce the results of the Axelrod cultural model. Among the questions we address are: what does it mean for two models to be equivalent, how can different standards of equivalence be statistically evaluated, and how do subtle differences in model design affect the results? After attaining a " docking" of the two models, the richer set of mechanisms of the Sugarscape model is used to provide two experiments in sensitivity analysis for the cultural rule of Axelrod's model.

Our generally positive experience in this enterprise has suggested that it could be beneficial if alignment and equivalence testing were more widely practiced among computational modelers.},

Chapter 6: Limitations of Systematic Reviews, and of the Model Itself
	[argues against master/doctoral abilities to do systematic reviews] \enquote{While research students undertaking doctoral work can hardly be expected to undertake systematic reviews themselves as part of the process (such reviews need more than one person),}

also: \enquote{Systematic literature reviews are usually international in scope, explicit in their inclusion and exclusion criteria, carried out by a team and subject to moderation at keywording and data extraction stages, and usually of a larger scale and more comprehensive than is usually possible for a single Masters, doctoral or expert researcher.}

It draws on existing examples in both educational research and development studies that have discussed the use of ethnography and action research in specific projects. Interpretations of ethnography and action research are developed that aim to minimise the epistemological differences between them. The paper also contextualises an `ethnographic action research' approach with reference to an example of the author's research into participation in three `reception' (first year of schooling) classes in the United Kingdom. It is argued that research into the theme of participation in early years education, using participative methods, was particularly suitable for this new methodological approach.},

	abstract = {Proof is central to mathematical practice, yet a perennial concern is that students of all ages struggle in learning to prove. Mathematics education scholars have suggested that overreliance on examples to justify the truth of statements is a contributing factor for students' difficulties. While example-based reasoning has typically been viewed as a stumbling block to learning to prove, we view example-based reasoning as an important object of study and posit that examples play both a foundational and an essential role in the development, exploration, and understanding of conjectures, as well as in subsequent attempts to develop proofs of those conjectures. In this paper, we provide an overview of our project whose goals were to (a) investigate the nature of middle school and high school students', undergraduate students', and mathematicians' thinking about the examples they use when developing, exploring, and proving conjectures; and (b) investigate ways in which thinking about and analyzing examples may facilitate the development of students' learning to prove.},

-- Data triangulation refers simply to using several data sources, the obvious example being the inclusion of more than one individual as a source of data. However, Denzin expands the notion of data triangulation to include time and space based on the assumption that understanding a social phenomenon requires its examination under a variety of conditions. So, for example, to study the effect of an inservice program on teachers, one should observe teachers at different times of the school day or year and in different settings such as the classroom and the teachers' lounge.

 -- Investigator triangulation, which involves more than one investigator in the research process, is also considered good practice. This perhaps more than other types of triangulation is usually built into the research process because most studies simply require more than one individual to accomplish the necessary data collection. However, the decision about who these multiple researchers should be and what their roles should be in the research process is problematic (Denzin, 1978; Miles, 1982). How much hands-on data collection the principal investigator needs to do in order to analyze the data, and how much data analysis is relegated to field workers because much of the analysis occurs as data are collected, are both relevant and not easily answered questions.

 -- Methodological triangulation is the most discussed type of triangulation and refers to the use of multiple methods in the examination of a social phenomenon. Psychologists have long used Denzin's notion of within-method triangulation in assessing psychological traits. Multiple scales comprise a psychological assessment such as an intelligence test in an effort to assess the different aspects of intelligence. The lie detector scale in some psychological inventories is another example. Denzin suggests that the within-methods triangulation approach has limited value, because essentially only one method is being used, and finds the between-methods triangulation strategy more satisfying. Other researchers seem to follow this lead and focus primarily on between methods triangulation. " The rationale for this strategy is that the flaws of one method are often the strengths of another: and by combining methods, observers can achieve the best of each while overcoming their unique deficiences" (Denzin, 1978, p. 302). It is with this type of triangulation that Denzin relies most heavily on the work of Webb et al. (1966) to suggest that the use of appropriate multiple methods will result in more valid research findings.},

	abstract = {Single-case designs refer to a methodological approach that can be used to investigate the effectiveness of treatment with the individual client. The designs permit scientifically valid inferences to be drawn about the effects of treatment and hence offer advantages over alternative strategies such as the uncontrolled case study or open study that are used with the individual case. The present article discusses the key features of the methodology, illustrates specific designs and how inferences are drawn, and discusses critical issues (feasibility, generality of results, ethical issues) in the use of the designs. Essential features of the design, including ongoing assessment and drawing on the underlying thinking and logic of the designs can improve the clinical care for individual clients, even when the rigors of experimentation are not feasible or desirable. Lamentably, single-case methods are rarely trained among researchers or practitioners in psychology or related mental health professions. The designs could play a special role by improving individual care and therapeutic change, apart from the strength of the methodology as a purely research tool.},

	abstract = {Problem frames are a sound and convenient approach to requirements modeling. Nevertheless, they are far less popular than other less rigorous approaches. One reason is that they employ a notation that is neither very appealing nor easy to use. The problem frames notation is sufficiently different from other development languages --especially UML-- to create an \enquote{impedance mismatch}: using problem frames to describe requirements does not help the transition to the design phase, makes it difficult for programmers to fully comprehend requirements, and does not favor traceability. As a consequence, problem frames are rarely adopted in software development processes employing UML as a design language. UML itself provides a linguistic support for requirements modeling, which however suffers from several limitations, especially as far as precision and formality are concerned.}}

 * [Australian Govt. Defn] Co-regulation is when `industry develops and administers a code and government provides the ability to enforce the code by giving it legislative backing in some way'. 
 * [OECD defn] Co-regulation is said to be when the `regulatory role is shared between government and industry. It is usually effected through legislative reference or endorsement of a code of practice' (OECD, 2002, p137)
 * Figure 5 gives levels of intervention from None to High, Competition to Monopoly
 * Another definition of co-regulation is `industry- association self-regulation with some oversight and/or ratification by government' and possibly participation by `public interest groups [Ayres I and Braithwaite J (1992), Responsive Regulation, Transcending the Deregulation Debate, p102, Oxford University Press.]},

	abstract = { The impact of technological change on employment, inequality and job quality has attracted considerable analysis from both scholars and practitioners. However, less attention has been paid to how digital technologies are changing contemporary workplaces and how workers are responding to these changes. This article reviews recent research from the multidisciplinary comparative employment relations field, with a focus on institutional resilience or change associated with digitalization; and the strategic responses of unions and other worker representatives to these trends. We find that the insights of economists, sociologists and employment relations scholars are complementary, as each addresses a different dimension of technological change and associated worker outcomes. Comparative employment relations researchers are more likely to influence current debates where they both articulate the unique contribution of their multi-method and comparative research methods and aggregate findings beyond single or paired industry and national case studies. },

A regression analysis using multiple outcome measures indicated substantial explanatory power (0.21 {	extless} R 2 {	extless}0.41). Analysis suggested that hybrid and agile approaches significantly increase stakeholder success over traditional approaches while achieving the same budget, time, scope, and quality outcomes. Hybrid approaches were found to be similar in effectiveness to fully agile approaches. Results validate decisions by practitioners to combine agile and traditional practices and suggest that hybrid is a leading project management approach.},

	abstract = {Overview: Agile project management aims to increase the flexibility of product development processes through increased interaction among project stakeholders. Since its introduction in the software industry 20 years ago, Agile project management has progressively spread to other contexts, even though large-scale organizations seem to struggle to switch toward Agile-only practices. In these contexts, we see an integration of the traditional Stage-Gate project management, focused on planning and validation, with Agile, focused on responsiveness and flexibility. Although it's effective, the Agile--Stage-Gate hybrid model is not easy to adopt, as it requires a clear alignment between the project team, the organizational objectives, and the project implementation. We collected interview data from eight Agile coaches experienced in Agile implementation in non-software industries. We identified practical actions that practitioners can use to manage the challenges connected to the implementation of hybrid models. These corrective actions can be grouped at three levels: integration aspects, cultural change, and perceptions of the Agile methodology.},

	abstract = {Purpose The paper aims to provide methodological support for hybrid project management, in which the discipline of predictive methodologies combines with the flexibility of adaptive ones. Specifically, the paper explores the extent complexity and volatility dimensions of organisational problems inform choices of PM methodologies both theoretically and in current practice, as a first step towards better methodological support for hybridisation. Design/methodology/approach The paper takes a mixed method approach, including both secondary research and primary research with practitioners. Primary research consists of a small scale survey (n = 31) followed by semi-structured interviews, with findings triangulated against secondary evidence. Findings The paper provides empirical insights on how complexity and volatility of organisational problems can inform hybrid project management practices. Specifically, it suggests a mapping between volatility and complexity dimensions and predictive and adaptive risk controls as a first step towards the systematisation of hybrid combinations in projects. Research limitations/implications Due to the small participant sample, the research results may lack generalisability. Practical implications The paper includes implications for the development of methodological support for setting up hybrid projects in practice. Originality/value The paper addresses a gap acknowledged both in the literature and by practitioners.},

Its purpose is to identify the challenges associated with implementing agile methods along with the established procedures for early design. The study exemplifies project leaders' experiences and implementation efforts. As leaders of design projects, they have proposed the use of a new method that involves teams engaging in testing and evaluation, which aids in the understanding and introduction of change initiatives. The challenges that are identified are as follows: (1) a lack of approval not only from top managers but also from critical peers; (2) an unprepared organization that did not allow teamwork; and (3) a lack of specific company success factors to support new methods.},

	abstract = {Despite growing interest in design science research in information systems, our understanding of what constitutes a design contribution and the range of research activities that can produce design contributions remains limited. We propose the Design Research Activity (DRA) framework for classifying design contributions based on the type of statements used to express knowledge contributions and the nature of the researcher role that led to them. These dimensions combine to produce a DRA framework containing four quadrants: construction, manipulation, deployment, and elucidation. We use the framework in two ways. First, we classify design contributions published in the Journal of the Association for Information Systems (JAIS) from 2007 to 2019 and show that a broad range of design research across all four quadrants is published. Second, we show how our framework can be used to analyze the maturity of design-oriented knowledge in a specific field, as reflected in the degree of activity across the different quadrants. The DRA framework contributes by showing that design research encompasses both design science research approaches, as well as design-oriented behavioral research approaches. The framework is useful to authors and reviewers in assessing research with design implications, and to researchers for positioning as well as understanding design research as a journey through the four quadrants.}}

While successful at the time, this rigid and inflexible management philosophy has become synonymous with cost and schedule overruns of most high-profile space missions. The software industry has recently adopted modern, more flexible project management techniques based on \enquote{lean-agile} methods that enable team collaboration and communication through distributed task and schedule management, online document sharing and rolling-wave planning. However, due to the inherent schedule complexities of hardware development and the firm constraints of design review and launch timelines, flexible project management frameworks have not been widely adopted for space mission management. This paper presents a modified version of the traditional agile management philosophy, adapted to the unique needs of the space industry. A recent satellite development project was managed using the new modified-agile approach, while collecting project hours and task durations. Comparisons were made between this new style of space project management and a recently completed satellite development project using traditional space project management techniques. Results show that the new management approach reduced strain on the project team, improved overall productivity, and maintained a more level task loading when compared to the traditional management approach. This paper also illustrates how the new management approach can enable project resilience to change by analyzing its response to the labor disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.},

	abstract = {Agile software development is considered as a game changer by some [1]. There are others who approach the domain more skeptical [2]. Clearly, there is a gap in terms of how Agile is perceived. This gap could be reduced, if proper measures would have been timely employed. Agile maturity assessment models have been helpful in providing means and guidance for reducing this gap. Yet, a detailed look into existing models, comparative studies and literature reviews in the domain suggests that the agile maturity assessment models themselves are far from being mature. Further, the gap between what the proposed models offer and what industry really needs is frequently discussed by those comparative studies. In this study, we reflect on the existing agile maturity assessment models, compare them against a comprehensive set of criteria derived from the literature and from our background in assessing the capabilities of software development organizations. We conclude that none of the analyzed agile maturity assessment models are sound enough to be used in a practical context. Nevertheless, some of the models have interesting elements that can be reused for the development of a new agile assessment model.},

To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) guidelines. The initial sample consisted of 142 articles, of which 42 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in detail. The findings show that the current research is in an exploratory phase, with a greater predominance of descriptive, nonexperimental, and cross-sectional studies that explore the prevalence of nomophobia mainly in adolescents and university students. The most widely used measurement instrument is the Nomophobia Questionnaire (NMP-Q) proposed by Yildrim and Correia. In addition, the research suggests that nomophobia negatively affects personality, self-esteem, anxiety, stress, academic performance, and other physical and mental health problems. We are therefore faced with a health problem, which negatively affects a person, causing psychological problems and physical and behavioral changes.},

It's totally relying upon us How to utilize it? One such live innovation is a Smartphone. At only one touch we approach any data about the entire world. It is very easy to carry in our pocket so everyone can use it anytime whenever. Smartphone has some constructive as well as some cynical aspects too. Nomophobia is a negative face of the smartphone. Nomophobia is the irrational dread of being without cell phones or being not able to utilize phones (situational phobia) for some reason such as some signal or battery issues. Theprimary point of the current research is to find out the proportion of Nomophobia among understudies with regardof gender and age in Agra city. For this purpose, a total number of 300 students were selected by randomization (150 males \& 150 females) from the age scope of 15-20 years. The data was taken by using a selfadministered questionnaire NMP-Q developed by Yilidirim and Correia. The obtained data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mean and Chi-square. Results revealed that there is a significant difference between male and female score on nomophobia. The other result indicates that early adolescents positively related to Nomophobia as compare to late adolescents. In India, one person can use multiple cell phones. There is no minimum age to use mobile phones. It is adding fuel to the pre-existing problem of Nomophobia. Telecom Administrative Authority of India (TRAI) should assume a functioning job by making an arrangement/law that "setting based methodology" on cell phone limitations among individuals ought to be followed. A demonstration will be detailed, under this demonstration. There ought to choose the least age for portable use. It will assist a great deal with curbing the circumstance.},

Significant differences between the agile and the plan-driven processes make meshing difficult, and very little empirical evidence on using agile processes for safety-critical software development exists. There are four areas of concern, in particular, for meshing the development of safety-critical software concerning: documentation, requirements, life cycle and testing. We report on a case study of a pharmaceutical organization in which a Scrum process was implemented to support agile software development in a plan-driven safety-critical project. The purpose was to answer the following research question: For safety-critical software, what can a software team do to mesh agile and plan-driven processes effectively? The main contribution of the paper is an elaborated understanding of meshing in the four areas of concern and how the conditions for safety-critical software influence them. We discuss how meshing within the four areas of concern is a contribution to existing research.},

	abstract = {Context: Over the past decade Software Engineering research has seen a steady increase in survey-based studies, and there are several guidelines providing support for those willing to carry out surveys. The need for auditing survey research has been raised in the literature. Checklists have been used both to conduct and to assess different types of empirical studies, such as experiments and case studies. Objective: To operationalize the assessment of survey studies by means of a checklist. To fulfill such goal, we aim to derive a checklist from standards for survey research and further evaluate the appropriateness of the checklist in the context of software engineering research. Method: We systematically aggregated knowledge from 12 methodological studies supporting survey-based research in software engineering. We identified the key stages of the survey process and its recommended practices through thematic analysis and vote counting. We evaluated the checklist by applying it to existing surveys and analyzed the results. Thereafter, we gathered the feedback of experts (the surveys' authors) on our analysis and used the feedback to improve the survey checklist. Results: The evaluation provided insights regarding limitations of the checklist in relation to its understanding and objectivity. In particular, 19 of the 38 checklist items were improved according to the feedback received from experts. Conclusion: The proposed checklist is appropriate for auditing survey reports as well as a support tool to guide ongoing research with regard to the survey design process. A discussion on how to use the checklist and what its implications are for research practice is also provided.},

	abstract = {The smart manufacturing systems (SMS) offer several advantages compared to the traditional manufacturing systems and are increasingly being adopted by manufacturing organizations as a strategy to improve their performance. Developing an SMS is expensive and complicated, integrating together various technologies such as automation, data exchanges, cyber-physical systems (CPS), artificial intelligence, internet of things (IoT), and semi-autonomous industrial systems. The Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) have limited resources and therefore, would like to see the benefits from investments before allowing adopting SMS. This study uses a combination of exploratory and empirical research design to identify and validate the performance measures relevant to the evaluation of SMS investments in auto-component manufacturing SMMEs based in India. The study found that an Industry 4.0 enabled SMS offer more competitive benefits compared to a traditional manufacturing system. The planned investments in SMS can be evaluated on ten performance dimensions namely, cost, quality, flexibility, time, integration, optimized productivity, real-time diagnosis \& prognosis, computing, social and ecological sustainability.

	abstract = {First discussed in depth in the 1970s in a published paper by William Royce about the development of large software systems, agile is a project management methodology composed of short incremental development cycles called \enquote{sprints.} Guided by four fundamental values and 12 principles in the Agile Manifesto, this provides an iterative and people-centric approach to software development and involves the following processes: * Planning: This first step involves customers and key stakeholders working together to conceptualize, brainstorm, define, prioritize, resource, and budget a project, which is then approved and initiated. * Design: User experience experts work with a Scrum master, client, product team, and other key stakeholders to determine what the product should look like and all of the other desired elements. * Development: In this build phase, the development team works through various iterations called \enquote{sprints} to create a product that meets the client's requirements. * Testing: This phase ensures the product is in line with requirements. Best suited for * High-performing software development teams, especially in the software development niche. * Organizations focused on high-quality deliverables and continuous improvement, especially if quality aligns with their value proposition or competitive differentiator. * Large and complex companies such as IBM, Cisco, AT\&T, and Microsoft streamline their processes and respond to changes faster using agile. * Project teams that regularly work closely with their customers and other external parties. * Teams that need quick feedback about deliverables rather than waiting until a project is fully complete. * Teams that need a more predictable and sequential project timeline and have a fixed budget. * Less experienced project teams. * Companies with a lower tolerance for change or risk. * Companies whose customers are limited by time and resources and cannot collaborate frequently. * Simple projects with simple requirements. * Projects that have the luxury of longer timelines.},

	abstract = {Despite several decades of dedicated R\&D, fusion, a potentially world-changing energy source, remains decades away from commercialisation. The majority of development thus far has been via publicly-funded programmes led by government laboratories focused on scientific research and in which commercialisation strategy and innovation play a minor role. Generally, such programmes follow a linear model of innovation in which commercial aspects are not considered until later in development. In consequence and without intention, devices not well-suited for commercial application are being pursued. In recent years, however, privately funded fusion start-ups have emerged with the goal of accelerating the commercialisation of fusion. Fusion start-ups are, by necessity, operating on a fundamentally different model of innovation: agile innovation, whereby technology is developed flexibly and iteratively towards an explicit commercial goal. Technology Roadmapping is a method that has been effective for supporting agile innovation but thus far has had limited application to mission-led hardware development. We characterise the key features of the fusion innovation approach and create a novel Technology Roadmapping process for fusion start-ups, which is developed via a case study with Tokamak Energy Ltd. The main elements of the developed process, the resulting Technology Roadmap, and its impact are presented.},

This paper presents a structured method to designing such a systematic approach which works adequately in small agile teams. It is independent of the underlying method such as Scrum, Kanban, etc., and is scalable to more and bigger teams or even entire subsidiaries. It is based on a compliance and a quality risk dimension which are both needed to fit regulatory requirements. The approach has been validated in the financial IT context with more than 100 developers in one subsidiary.},

	abstract = {Agile-Stage-Gate is a hybrid product development model that integrates elements of both Agile and Stage-Gate to help companies realize the strengths of both. Recent studies show positive results in manufacturing companies, although SMEs are notably absent despite being the majority. This paper reports results of a test of the model in three deliberately chosen manufacturing SMEs. Results were improved: time to market, overall new product process, higher success rate. Agile required adaptations, and novel solutions were found by the test firms. The positive results suggest that Agile-Stage-Gate must be considered as a recommended product development approach in SME manufacturers.},

However, certain complications arise when applying the concept of agility in the hardware. In this publication, based on the challenges identified by Ovesen in 2012, the current challenges of agile development for hardware are gathered using an embedded design approach, ensuring its actuality based on the latest surveys and empirical data. The current state regarding the challenges is displayed and its interrelations as well as their advancements compared to seven years ago is discussed. Moreover, an attempt to explain the difficulties of applying agile development is given by a hardware-related complexity model.},

The sample included North American project managers with five years' experience, 25 years of age or older, and experience with multiple project management methodologies. The survey instrument consisted of 58 questions, utilizing a 5-point Likert scale to record responses. The survey contained three sections, including demographic information, questions related to a successful project, and questions related to a less-than successful (failed / challenged) project. 367 usable responses were received. The examination of the constructs included Pearson's correlation coefficient as well as linear regression to determine the impact of moderating variables. Results indicated that project management methodology has a weak correlation with reported project success, and this correlation is not moderated by industry nor project manager experience. The results did not align with previously conducted studies, illustrating a need to continue the study of methods impacting success including investigating additional moderating variables.{	extless}/p{	extgreater}{	extless}/section{	extgreater}},

	abstract = {Background: Agile methods are no longer restricted to small projects and co-located teams. The last decade has seen the spread of agile into large scale, distributed and regulated domains. Many case studies show successful agile adoption in GSD, however, taken as a whole, it remains unclear how widespread this trend is, and what form the agile adoption takes in a global software development (GSD) setting. Aims: Our objective is to gain a deeper understanding of how organisations adopt agile development methods in distributed settings. Specifically we aim to plot the current development process landscape in GSD. Method: We analyse industrial survey data from 33 different countries collected as part of the project that explored the wider use of hybrid development approaches in software development. We extract and analyse the results of 263 surveys completed by participants involved in globally distributed projects. Results: In our sample, 72 of globally distributed projects implement a mix of both agile and traditional approaches (termed `hybrid'). 25 of GSD organisations are predominantly agile, with only very few (5) opting for traditional approaches. GSD projects that used only agile methods tended to be very large. Conclusions: Globally Distributed Software Development (and project size) is not a barrier to adopting agile practices. Yet, to facilitate project coordination and general project management, many adopt traditional approaches, resulting in a hybrid approach that follows defined rules.},

	abstract = {Agile development is no silver bullet - therefore, the contribution investigates how the perception of agility is changing over time as well as from different viewpoints. The results discussed in this contribution have been obtained in the course of two studies, which have been carried out in both 2017 and 2018. The focus of that studies' series is the field of agile development of physical products. The 2017 study revealed that agile hardware development shows benefits rather in `soft' factors like transparency, commitment and communication. Expectations in the `hard' factors (controlling KPI's) quality, cost and time-to-market are overestimated and thus hyped, as of today. Based on the findings of 2017, a follow-up study has been conducted to investigate how the field of agile hardware development has matured over time and how the hype is evolving. It turned out that there is a large deviation in terms of the expectations and thus the different perspectives of both project management and research and development, which are the key drivers of the hype.},

Objective: The aim of this work is to enable the comparison of existing AMMs. Method: We identified 14 AMMs in a non-systematic literature review, considering non-scientific sources as well. We propose criteria for their comparison based on our experience and our understanding of practitioners' needs. Results: We present twelve comparison criteria and show how the identified AMMs differ along those criteria. Conclusion: Practitioners get an overview of existing models and can select a suitable one with the help of the comparison criteria.},

While empirical studies on the use and the effects of MBE in industry exist, only few of them target the embedded systems domain. We contribute to the body of knowledge with an empirical study on the use and the assessment of MBE in that particular domain. The goal of this study is to assess the current state-of-practice and the challenges the embedded systems domain is facing due to shortcomings with MBE. We collected quantitative data from 113 subjects, mostly professionals working with MBE, using an online survey. The collected data spans different aspects of MBE, such as the used modeling languages, tools, notations, effects of MBE introduction, or shortcomings of MBE. Our main findings are that MBE is used by a majority of all participants in the embedded systems domain, mainly for simulation, code generation, and documentation. Reported positive effects of MBE are higher quality and improved reusability. Main shortcomings are interoperability difficulties between MBE tools, high training effort for developers and usability issues. Our study offers valuable insights into the current industrial practice and can guide future research in the fields of systems modeling and embedded systems.},

	abstract = {Manufacturing has evolved and become more automated, computerised and complex. In this paper, the origin, current status and the future developments in manufacturing are disused. Smart manufacturing is an emerging form of production integrating manufacturing assets of today and tomorrow with sensors, computing platforms, communication technology, control, simulation, data intensive modelling and predictive engineering. It utilises the concepts of cyber-physical systems spearheaded by the internet of things, cloud computing, service-oriented computing, artificial intelligence and data science. Once implemented, these concepts and technologies would make smart manufacturing the hallmark of the next industrial revolution. The essence of smart manufacturing is captured in six pillars, manufacturing technology and processes, materials, data, predictive engineering, sustainability and resource sharing and networking. Material handling and supply chains have been an integral part of manufacturing. The anticipated developments in material handling and transportation and their integration with manufacturing driven by sustainability, shared services and service quality and are outlined. The future trends in smart manufacturing are captured in ten conjectures ranging from manufacturing digitisation and material-product-process phenomenon to enterprise dichotomy and standardisation.},

	abstract = {In project management research, it is acknowledged that two perspectives on project performance must be considered: project efficiency (delivering efficient outputs) and project success (delivering beneficial outcomes). The first perspective is embedded in a deterministic paradigm of project management, while the second appears more naturally connected to the emerging non-deterministic paradigm. Complexity and uncertainty are key constructs frequently associated with the non-deterministic paradigm. This conceptual paper suggests that these two concepts could very well explain and define particularities of both paradigms, and seeks to articulate both perspectives in a contingent model. First, the constructs of complexity and uncertainty are clarified. Second, the role of project managers' mental models in managerial decision-making is considered. In the third part of this article, we propose a theoretical model suggesting that project managers should consider contingent variables to differentiate managerial conditions of regulation from managerial conditions of emergence.},

Agile methods, which include time-boxed sprints, daily stand-up meetings, and early demos and retrospectives, are typically embedded within some or all of the stages of an existing Stage-Gate system. This article presents six case studies from major firms experimenting with Agile--StageGate hybrids. These results show that early outcomes of these efforts are quite positive; some firms report significant improvements in both time to market and development productivity, as well as faster responses to changing market conditions and customer needs and higher project team morale. However, they also identified many challenges in implementing Agile--Stage-Gate hybrids, including addressing management skepticism, finding the needed resources to field dedicated teams, and dealing with fluid product definitions and development plans. Based on case firms' experiences, we provide recommendations for implementing a hybrid product development system.},

	abstract = {Context
Regulatory authorities require proofs from critical systems manufacturers that the software in their products is developed in accordance to prescribed development practices before accepting the product to the markets. This is challenging when using DevOps, where continuous integration and deployment are the default practices, which are not a good match with the regulatory software development standards.
Objective
We aim to bring DevOps and regulated software development closer to each other. First, we want to make it easier for developers to develop regulated software with tools and practices they are familiar with. Second, we want to allow regulatory authorities to build confidence on solutions provided by manufacturers by defining a mapping between DevOps and regulatory software development.
Method
We performed a literature survey and created research suggestions using exploratory research.
Results
Tighter integration between development tools, requirements management, version control and deployment pipeline would simplify the creation of regulatory compliant development practices.
Conclusions
Regulations could be improved for more agile and incremental method in quality approval, the final step before the actual deployment of the software. Improved development practices and tool integration, created in cooperation by tool vendors, system providers, and regulatory authorities, could support developers who are not comfortable with fixed, and rigid practices of regulated software development.},

In addition to modern management approaches, software just as well as hardware is of great importance to ensure competitive advantage if the company needs to keep pace with industrial requirements. Information sector can be seen as a competition opportunity for emerging countries. To be able to exploit this opportunity, companies need to be agile and innovative. In this paper, we suggest a process innovation which is intended to be a new model for designing an efficient and effective software process. The model was applied at a software company, and the results of this study are reported here. Lean and agile approaches were used, and as a result, the firm achieved significant improvements in cost, time, labor force, quality, internal and external customer satisfaction, speed, reliability and productivity.},

	abstract = {Many large organizations are adopting agile software development as part of their continuous push towards higher flexibility and shorter lead times, yet few reports on large-scale agile transformations are available in the literature. In this paper we report how Ericsson introduced agile in a new R\&D product development program developing a XaaS platform and a related set of services, while simultaneously scaling it up aggressively. The overarching goal for the R\&D organization, distributed to five sites at two continents, was to achieve continuous feature delivery. This single case study is based on 45 semi-structured interviews during visits at four sites, and five observation sessions at three sites. We describe how the organization experimented with different set-ups for their tens of agile teams aiming for rapid end-to-end development: from component-based virtual teams to totally cross-functional, cross-component, cross-site teams. Moreover, we discuss the challenges the organization faced and how they mitigated them on their journey towards continuous and rapid software engineering. We present four lessons learned for large-scale agile transformations: 1) consider using an experimental approach to transformation, 2) consider implementing the transformation step-wise in complex large-scale settings, 3) team inter-changeability can be limited in a complex large-scale product --- specialization might be needed, and 4) not using a common agile framework for the whole organization, in combination with insufficient common trainings and coaching may lead to a lack of common direction in the agile implementation. Further in-depth case studies on large-scale agile transformations, on customizing agile to large-scale settings, as well as on the use of scaling frameworks are needed.},

	abstract = {Medical device software development organizations are bound by regulatory requirements and constraints to ensure that developed medical devices will not harm patients. Medical devices have to be treated as complete systems and be evaluated in this manner. Instead of manufacturers having to ensure compliance to various regulatory standards individually, the authors previously developed a medical device software process assessment framework called MDevSPICE{	extregistered} that integrates the regulatory requirements from all the relevant medical device software standards. The MDevSPICE{	extregistered} was developed in a manner that suits plan-driven software development. To improve the usability of MDevSPICE{	extregistered} in agile settings, we extended the assessment approach. The hybrid assessment approach described here combines the MDevSPICE{	extregistered}-based process assessment method with steps for prioritization of improvement needs through value stream mapping and enabling process improvement through the use of KATA technique. This approach integrates agile methods into the medical device software development process while adhering to the requirements of the regulatory standards. This paper describes the implementation of the approach within 4 organizations that develop software in line with medical device regulations.},

	abstract = {Background Agile development shows benefits for software-developing companies, eg, shorter time to market or stronger customer connections. Nonetheless, agile methods and practices are most often adapted to a specific context. Especially in regulated domains such as automotive, avionics, or medical, domain-specific constraints need to be considered, and hence, Agile is often used only partially or not at all. Objective The goal of this study was to identify the state of the practice in using agile development as part of the development process in regulated embedded domains. Method We conducted a study using a combination of a series of interviews and an online questionnaire as data collection methods. Results The responses of 50 participants showed that Agile, mostly in the form of an adapted form of Scrum, has already arrived in those domains, but mainly in noncritical projects and/or early project phases. This means there is further improvement potential, which was also confirmed by the participants regarding future usage. Conclusions The results of our state-of-the-practice study provide a good stage for future work, especially for new approaches bringing more \enquote{agility} into regulated embedded domains.},

4.3.3 Agile elements and adaptions
Most common practices used : short iterations, incremental development \& pair programming.
Most common adaption: need for documentation [As expected in embedded domain, and influence of V-lifecycle]. Requirements architecture and design specification required by regulations. Also risk management and traceability of requirements need to be documented.
Also, not obligated to deliver value in every sprint due to proximity to hardware.
Figure 2: illustrates clear trend of a move towards agile.
 
5.1
Agile is more frequently used predominantly in pure software related processes (76-93\%), rather than processes on the system level (26-33\%)
4.5 \& 5.1
Introduction of Agile - predominantly step-wise, incremental adoption (lower risk this way.) Used on pilot project first. Team/project level (not organisational.)
5.1.1
Scrum is the most common practice, but rarely used by the book. [Hence already being tailored]
5.1.2
Product owner came from the internal organisation - as would be expected with SME projects, expected generally of smaller size, and customer is not going to pay for their engineer to be on-site, as would possibly occur with larger projects (eg ELMS aerospace project)
5.2 Future agile usage
some participants believed probably end up with a hybrid process and not a completely agile process or organisation.
Barriers to agile adoption:  organisational resistance to change, management fear losing control, perceived lack of planning and predictability, losing management control. Fear of unknown, fear of change, change in company mindset.
Lack of customer desire to be involved because they just want to see final product [ perhaps customers do not want to 'waste' their time evaluating early releases. Need to find early adopters. Also, use internal staff such as sales or applications to represent the customer]
[Requires senior management backing - as discovered on M815 course]},

	abstract = {Context: Agile software development has nowadays reached wide adoption. However, moving agile to large-scale contexts is a complex task with many challenges involved. Objective: In this paper, we review practices, challenges, and success factors for scaling agile both from literature and within a large software company, identifying the most critical factors. Method: We conduct a focused literature review to map the importance of scaling practices, challenges, and success factors. The outcome of this focused literature review is used to guide action research within a software company with a view to scaling agile processes. Results: Company culture, prior agile and lean experience, management support, and value unification were found to be key success factors during the action research process. Resistance to change, an overly aggressive roll-out time frame, quality assurance concerns, and integration into preexisting nonagile business processes were found to be the critical challenges in the scaling process. Conclusion: The action research process allowed to cross-fertilize ideas from literature to the company's context. Scaling agile within an organization does not need to follow a specific scheme, rather the process can be tailored to the needs while keeping the core values and principles of agile methodologies.},

	abstract = {Rockwell Collins, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, is using a product line approach for a family of radios they produce for military and international markets, with an agile systems engineering process tailored individually for synchronized software, firmware, and hardware development. This mixed-discipline engineering group encompasses some 350 employees working on multiple projects simultaneously for multiple customers. The product line approach provides an agile systems target-context for the agile systems engineering process - re-using common product-line hardware, firmware, and software whenever possible, evolving the product line with both internally-funded development and opportunities presented by customer project work, and accommodating special customer needs that grow the knowledge and capability base for potential later use in product-line extension. This article focuses on the mixed-discipline agile systems engineering process reviewed in the September, 2015, INCOSE Agile Systems Engineering Life Cycle Model (ASELCM) discovery workshop, and doesn't address the proprietary strategy and detail of the product line architecture. Notable elements that will be discussed include a parallel evolving product line roadmap as the strategic driving function, a facilitating central relationship-management role for systems engineering, synchronization of mixed engineering disciplines, an enabling infrastructure for agile hardware development, strong opportunity management complimenting traditional risk management, and comparison to the ASELCM Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) pattern.},

Interestingly, waterfall remains the most widely used practice, suggesting that there is something missing from the many "flavors" of agile methodologies. We explore seven of the most common practices to explore this, and evaluate each against a series of criteria centered around product quality and adherence to agile practices. We find that no methodology entirely replaces waterfall and summarize the strengths and weaknesses of each. From this, we conclude that agile methods are, as a whole, unable to cope with the realities of technical debt and large scale systems. Ultimately, no one methodology fits all projects.},

	abstract = {Agile methods have become popular in recent years because the success rate of project development using Agile methods is better than structured design methods. Nevertheless, less than 50 percent of projects implemented using Agile methods are considered successful, and selecting the wrong Agile method is one of the reasons for project failure. Selecting the most appropriate Agile method is a challenging task because there are so many to choose from. In addition, potential adopters believe that migrating to an Agile method involves taking a drastic risk. Therefore, to assist project managers and other decision makers, this study aims to identify the key factors that should be considered when selecting an appropriate Agile method. A systematic literature review was performed to elicit these factors in an unbiased manner and then content analysis was used to analyze the resultant data. It was found that the nature of project, development team skills, project constraints, customer involvement and organizational culture are the key factors that should guide decision makers in the selection of an appropriate Agile method based on the value these factors have for different organizations and/or different projects.},

	abstract = {Purpose Aligning the project management methodology (PMM) to a particular project is considered to be essential for project success. Many outsourced software projects fail to deliver on time, budget or do not give value to the client due to inappropriate choice of a PMM. Despite the increasing range of available choices, project managers frequently fail to seriously consider their alternatives. They tend to narrowly tailor project categorization systems and categorization criterion is often not logically linked with project objectives. The purpose of this paper is to develop and test a contingency fit model comparing the differences between critical success factors (CSFs) for outsourced software development projects in the current context of traditional plan-based and agile methodologies. Design/methodology/approach A theoretical model and 54 hypotheses were developed from a literature review. An online Qualtrics survey was used to collect data to test the proposed model. The survey was administered to a large sample of senior software project managers and practitioners who were involved in international outsourced software development projects across the globe with 984 valid responses. Findings Results indicate that various CSFs differ significantly across agile and traditional plan-based methodologies, and in different ways for various project success measures. Research limitations/implications This study is cross-sectional in nature and data for all variables were obtained from the same sources, meaning that common method bias remains a potential threat. Further refinement of the instrument using different sources of data for variables and future replication using longitudinal approach is highly recommended. Practical implications Practical implications of these results suggest project managers should tailor PMMs according to various organizational, team, customer and project factors to reduce project failure rates. Originality/value Unlike previous studies this paper develops and empirically validates a contingency fit model comparing the differences between CSFs for outsourced software development projects in the context of PMMs.},

	abstract = {Software and system development faces numerous challenges of rapidly changing markets. To address such challenges, companies and projects design and adopt specific development approaches by combining well-structured comprehensive methods and flexible agile practices. Yet, the number of methods and practices is large, and available studies argue that the actual process composition is carried out in a fairly ad-hoc manner. The present paper reports on a survey on hybrid software development approaches. We study which approaches are used in practice, how different approaches are combined, and what contextual factors influence the use and combination of hybrid software development approaches. Our results from 69 study participants show a variety of development approaches used and combined in practice. We show that most combinations follow a pattern in which a traditional process model serves as framework in which several fine-grained (agile) practices are plugged in. We further show that hybrid software development approaches are independent from the company size and external triggers. We conclude that such approaches are the results of a natural process evolution, which is mainly driven by experience, learning, and pragmatism.},

Often those who conduct AR investigations build on their professional expertise to provide a valuable service to a client organization while at the same time furthering knowledge in their academic fields. AR is usually conducted using an interpretive research approach, but many doctoral IS students, as well as junior and senior IS researchers, are likely to be expected to conduct research in a predominantly positivist fashion, even as they are determined to conduct an AR study that builds on their professional expertise. We argue that these IS researchers can successfully employ AR in their investigations as long as they are aware of the methodological obstacles that they may face, and have the means to overcome them. The following key obstacles are discussed: low statistical power, common-method bias, and multilevel influences. We also discuss two important advantages of employing AR in positivist IS investigations, from a positivist perspective: AR's support for the identification of omitted variables and J-curve relationships. The study's contribution is expected to enhance our knowledge of AR and foster its practice.},

Due to inherent incompatibilities, for years, studying Scrum and its application in distributed setups has been subject to theoretical and applied research, and an increasing body of knowledge reports insights into this combination. Through a systematic literature review, this paper contributes a collection of experiences on the application of Scrum to global software engineering (GSE). In total, we identified 40 challenges in 19 categories practitioners face when using Scrum in GSE. Among the challenges, scaling Scrum to GSE and adopting practices accordingly are the most frequently named. Our findings also show that most solution proposals aim at modifying elements of the Scrum core processes. We thus conclude that, even though Scrum allows for extensive modification, Scrum itself represents a barrier for global software engineering, and development teams have to customize Scrum properly to benefit from agile software development in GSE.},

Adopting these modern approaches in regulatory environments, such as medical device software, is not straightforward because of the demand for regulatory compliance. While DevOps relies on continuous deployment and integration, regulated environments require strict audits and approvals before releases. Therefore, the use of modern development approaches in regulatory environments is rare, as is the research on the topic. However, as software is more and more predominant in medical devices, modern software development approaches become attractive. This paper discusses the fit of DevOps for regulated medical device software development. We examine two related standards, IEC 62304 and IEC 82304-1, for obstacles and benefits of using DevOps for medical device software development. We found these standards to set obstacles for continuous delivery and integration. Respectively, development tools can help fulfilling the requirements of traceability and documentation of these standards.},

	abstract = {Distributed software engineering and agility are strongly pushing on today's software industry. Due to inherent incompatibilities, for years, studying Scrum and its application in distributed setups has been subject to theoretical and applied research, and an increasing body of knowledge reports insights into this combination. Through a systematic literature review, this paper contributes a collection of experiences on the application of Scrum to global software engineering (GSE). In total, we identified 40 challenges in 19 categories practitioners face when using Scrum in GSE. Among the challenges, scaling Scrum to GSE and adopting practices accordingly are the most frequently named. Our findings also show that most solution proposals aim at modifying elements of the Scrum core processes. We thus conclude that, even though Scrum allows for extensive modification, Scrum itself represents a barrier for global software engineering, and development teams have to customize Scrum properly to benefit from agile software development in GSE.},

	abstract = {Software is increasingly being used to provide functionality in safety critical domains. The complexity involved in the development of software for these domains can bring challenges concerned with safety. International standards are published, providing information on practices which must be implemented in order to satisfy the regulations. This paper details an investigation of the relevant standards that companies need to implement in order to satisfy the regulatory requirements. A literature review was conducted which examines the relevant Quality Management System, Risk Management and Software Development standards across the safety critical domains; and examines the challenges faced by software development organizations with standard and multiple standard implementation. The existing approaches to standards consolidation, integration and harmonization were also examined. To investigate the challenges in implementing these standards, interviews were conducted with a medical device software development company having a Quality Management System in place and beginning to implement the relevant Software Development standards. In addition, an interview was conducted with a consultancy company who has experience in the implementation and maintenance of Quality Management Systems in small and medium enterprises. Following the literature review and interviews conducted, a comparison of the standards was conducted to investigate the similarities and differences in the structure of sections and subsections and to estimate the potential for the further consolidation of these standards. Following the results of the comparisons, a detailed mapping of standard requirements was conducted, mapping requirements of generic and domain specific Quality Management System standards. Future work will focus on the consolidation and integration of standards practices which need to be implemented by companies developing safety critical software and development of Unified Framework that incorporates all necessary requirements to comply with regulatory requirements.},

Today, organizations require better use of data and analytics to support their business decisions. Internet power and business trend changes have provided a broad term for data analytics - Big Data. To be able to handle it and leverage a value of having access to Big Data, organizations have no other choice than to get proper systems implemented and working. However, traditional methods are not efficient for changing business needs. Long time between project start and go-live causes a gap between initial solution blueprint and actual user requirements at the end of the project. This article presents the latest market trends in BI systems implementation by comparing agile with traditional methods. It presents a case study provided in a large telecommunications company (350 BI users) and the results of a pilot research provided in the three large companies: media, digital, and insurance. Both studies prove that agile methods might be more effective in BI projects from an end-user perspective and give first results and added value in a much shorter time compared to a traditional approach. {	extless}/p{	extgreater}{	extless}/section{	extgreater}},

	abstract = {Avionic systems for communication, navigation, and flight control, and many other functions are complex and crucial components of any modern aircraft. Present day avionic systems are increasingly based on computers and a growing percentage of system complexity can be attributed to software. An error in the software of a safety-critical avionic system could lead to a catastrophic event, such as multiple deaths and loss of the aircraft. To demonstrate compliance with airworthiness requirements, certification agencies accept the use of RTCA document DO-178 for the software development. Avionics software development is typically complex and is traditionally reliant on a strict plan-driven development process, characterized by early fixture of detailed requirements and late production of working software. In this process, requirement changes and solving software errors can lead to much rework, and create a risk of budget and schedule overruns. This raises the question whether avionics software development could benefit from the application of agile approaches. Based on the results of three activities: (1) a literature study on industrial experience with the use of agile methods in a DO-178 context, (2) an expert assessment of the DO-178 objectives, and (3) a survey conducted among European avionics industry, an outline is presented of an agile development process, where Scrum is extended to achieve the DO-178 objectives. The application of agile methods is expected to support frequent delivery of working software and ability to respond to changes, resulting in reduced risk of budget and schedule overruns.},

However, a lack of empirical knowledge of performing safety assurance techniques, especially safety analysis in a real agile project hampers further steps. Aims: In this article, we aim at (1) understanding and optimizing the S-Scrum development process, a Scrum extension with the integration of a systems theory based safety analysis technique, STPA (System-Theoretic Process Analysis), for safety-critical systems; (2) validating the Optimized S-Scrum development process further. Method: We conducted a two-stage exploratory case study in a student project at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. Results: The results in stage 1 showed that S-Scrum helps to ensure safety of each release but is less agile than the normal Scrum. We explored six challenges on: priority management; communication; time pressure on determining safety requirements; safety planning; time to perform upfront planning; and safety requirements' acceptance criteria. During stage 2, the safety and agility have been improved after the optimizations, including an internal and an external safety expert; pre-planning meeting; regular safety meeting; an agile safety plan; and improved safety epics and safety stories. We have also gained valuable suggestions from industry, but the generalization problem due to the specific context is still unsolved.},

	abstract = {Purpose Aligning the project management methodology (PMM) to a particular project is considered to be essential for project success. Many outsourced software projects fail to deliver on time, budget or do not give value to the client due to inappropriate choice of a PMM. Despite the increasing range of available choices, project managers frequently fail to seriously consider their alternatives. They tend to narrowly tailor project categorization systems and categorization criterion is often not logically linked with project objectives. The purpose of this paper is to develop and test a contingency fit model comparing the differences between critical success factors (CSFs) for outsourced software development projects in the current context of traditional plan-based and agile methodologies. Design/methodology/approach A theoretical model and 54 hypotheses were developed from a literature review. An online Qualtrics survey was used to collect data to test the proposed model. The survey was administered to a large sample of senior software project managers and practitioners who were involved in international outsourced software development projects across the globe with 984 valid responses. Findings Results indicate that various CSFs differ significantly across agile and traditional plan-based methodologies, and in different ways for various project success measures. Research limitations/implications This study is cross-sectional in nature and data for all variables were obtained from the same sources, meaning that common method bias remains a potential threat. Further refinement of the instrument using different sources of data for variables and future replication using longitudinal approach is highly recommended. Practical implications Practical implications of these results suggest project managers should tailor PMMs according to various organizational, team, customer and project factors to reduce project failure rates. Originality/value Unlike previous studies this paper develops and empirically validates a contingency fit model comparing the differences between CSFs for outsourced software development projects in the context of PMMs.},

	abstract = {Increased globalisation and market volatility put pressure on organisations to become more flexible and explore new technologies and operational domains, so that projects are becoming more complex, with increasing uncertainty and risk. Complex project management is challenging for both traditional and agile approaches: traditional techniques may be left behind by unrecognised environmental change in a volatile context, while in a stable environment, agile may require too expensive interaction with the client. One area of growing interest is how traditional and agile may combine to increase the chance of project success. Yet how to strike a balance between the two remains poorly understood.  In this position paper, we propose a model for complex socio-technical projects related to risk arising from volatility, that tries to explain the balance of agile and traditional. The model introduces the concept of drift rate as a measure of volatility, with the impact of drift related to loss of development resource, risk accumulation as a function of resource expenditure and drift rate, and validation the means to manage that risk.},

We found 79 of 90 SAFe (R) Team level practices partly or wholly implement GTM recommendations.

	abstract = {Agile methods are widely utilized in software development but their usage in embedded system development is often limited to software. A case study of three industrial cases was carried out to understand how to tailor agile methods effectively including also hardware development. Agile practices, mostly derived from Scrum, were tailored to fit the needs of each team and the method development was closely followed. Surveys conducted in the beginning and in the end of the cases were compared and complemented with interviews to understand the new working methods and their effects. Case evidence shows that interdependencies between work of each developer were taken into account better, visibility over the whole product increased and need for internal documentation diminished due to improved communication, but dividing hardware tasks into iterations was experienced difficult. With some tailoring, agile practices are beneficial also in the embedded system development. To successfully adopt agile methods into embedded system development, the team must consist of all the project members, the natural cycle lengths of different disciplines and different knowledge between the developers must be accepted and built upon, and the progress of the product must be presented or visualized in the end of each iteration.},

	abstract = {Among many factors that influence the success of a software project, the software process model employed is an essential one. An improper process model will be time consuming, error-prone and cost expensive, and further lower the quality of software. Therefore, how to choose an appropriate software process model is a very important problem for software development. Current works focus on the selection criteria and often lead to subjective results. In this paper, we propose a software process model recommendation method, to help project managers choose the most appropriate software process model for a new project at an early stage of development process according to historical software engineering data. The proposed method casts the process model recommendation into a classification problem. It first evaluates the different combinations of the alternative classification and attribute selection algorithms, and the best one is used to build the recommendation model with historical software engineering data; then, the constructed recommendation model is used to predict process models for a new software project with only a few data. We also analyze the mutual impacts between process models and different types of project factors, to further help managers locate the most suitable process model. We found process models are also responsible for defect count, defect severity and software change. Experiments on the data sets from 37 different development teams of different countries show that the average recommendation accuracy of our method reaches up to 82.5\%, which makes it potentially useful in practice.},

The trend began first in the IT industry, where Agile and Stage-Gate methods were found to complement each other, and only recently has been seen in manufacturing firms. The benefits of the hybrid model include much faster product releases, better response to changing customer requirements, and improved team communication and morale. But some modifications to the Agile model are required for physical products. Two large-company best-practice examples are provided to illustrate how to run a hybrid model.},

	abstract = {DevOps is a predominant phenomenon in the web domain. Its two core principles emphasize collaboration between software development and operations, and the use of agile principles to manage deployment environments and their configurations. DevOps techniques, such as collaboration and behaviour-driven monitoring, have been used by web companies to facilitate continuous deployment of new functionality to customers. The techniques may also offer opportunities for continuous product improvement when adopted in the embedded systems domain. However, certain characteristics of embedded software development present obstacles for DevOps adoption, and as yet, there is no empirical evidence of its adoption in the embedded systems domain. In this study, we present the challenges for DevOps adoption in embedded systems using a multiple-case study approach with four companies. The contribution of this paper is to introduce the concept of DevOps adoption in the embedded systems domain and then to identify key challenges for the DevOps adoption.},

	abstract = {Evaluation of design artefacts and design theories is a key activity in Design Science Research (DSR), as it provides feedback for further development and (if done correctly) assures the rigour of the research. However, the extant DSR literature provides insufficient guidance on evaluation to enable Design Science Researchers to effectively design and incorporate evaluation activities into a DSR project that can achieve DSR goals and objectives. To address this research gap, this research paper develops, explicates, and provides evidence for the utility of a Framework for Evaluation in Design Science (FEDS) together with a process to guide design science researchers in developing a strategy for evaluating the artefacts they develop within a DSR project. A FEDS strategy considers why, when, how, and what to evaluate. FEDS includes a two-dimensional characterisation of DSR evaluation episodes (particular evaluations), with one dimension being the functional purpose of the evaluation (formative or summative) and the other dimension being the paradigm of the evaluation (artificial or naturalistic). The FEDS evaluation design process is comprised of four steps: (1) explicate the goals of the evaluation, (2) choose the evaluation strategy or strategies, (3) determine the properties to evaluate, and (4) design the individual evaluation episode(s). The paper illustrates the framework with two examples and provides evidence of its utility via a naturalistic, summative evaluation through its use on an actual DSR project.},

To evaluate the effectiveness of the framework, we conducted an experiment where subjects were asked to design the color scheme for a website.

Now those methods are spreading across a broad range of industries and functions and even reaching into the C-suite. But many executives don't understand how to promote and benefit from agile; often they manage in ways that run counter to its principles and practices, undermining the effectiveness of agile teams in their organizations. From their work studying and advising companies that have successfully employed agile methods, the authors have discerned six crucial practices for capitalizing on agile's potential: (1) Learn how agile really works; (2) understand when it is appropriate; (3) start small and let passionate evangelists spread the word; (4) allow teams that have mastered the process to customize their practices; (5) practice agile at the top; and (6) destroy corporate barriers to agile behaviors. They expand on each, providing executives with a practical guide for accelerating innovation and profitable growth.  INSET: Agile Values and Principles.},

The motivation behind the software globalisation is competitive advantage and business profits that it yields to an organisation. Besides, these organisations are facing various challenges due to the distributed nature of the software development. However, software process improvement (SPI) is one of the biggest issues in the domain of global software development (GSD). The aim of this research study is to identify success factors and barriers to assist GSD organisations for successful implementation of SPI program. Accordingly, a systematic literature review approach was adopted to identify the success factors and barriers. A total of nine success factors and six barriers were identified that could impact SPI. Using the criteria of the factors having a frequency {	extgreater}50\% as critical, total four success factors were ranked as critical success factors, i.e. management commitment, staff involvement, allocated resources and pilot projects. Moreover, total four barriers were classified as critical barriers, i.e. lack of resources, inexperienced staff, organisational politics and time pressure.},

It is not clear how these practices can be successfully used together in an organisation. Aims: We investigate practitioners' mitigation strategies related to the challenge of doing Agile in a non-Agile environment. Method: Strategies were collected during two studies, an online survey and an interactive workshop run at an Agile meetup and analysed thematically. Results: Strategies related to the wider organisation and not just software development. Two perspectives emerged from the data: an organisational and a change perspective. Five organisational themes were identified with Management and decision-making and Culture the two biggest themes. Nine change themes were identified, with Being open, Using specific approaches and Educating the biggest themes. Conclusions: Better understanding is needed of how Agile practitioners can accomplish bottom-up change in their organisation.},

	abstract = {Agile development methodologies have been widely employed in the software industry, where they have been found to yield positive results. But can these new methods, with their new tools such as sprints, scrums, burndown charts, and backlogs, really be integrated with the traditional and popular Stage-Gate approach and then applied to physical products? Initial but limited evidence suggests yes: Larger IT firms have already integrated Agile and Stage-Gate and gained the benefits of both approaches; and most recently, a handful of manufacturing firms have employed this Agile-Stage-Gate hybrid model for physical new products. And if recent evidence can be trusted, this new approach promises to be the most significant change to our thinking about how new-product development should be done since the introduction of today's popular gating systems 30 years ago. The benefits of this hybrid model are a faster and more adaptive response to changing customer needs, better integration of voice-of-customer, better team communication, improved development productivity, and faster to market. A case example from a toy company, LEGO, is provided as an illustration. But there are negatives as well, and additionally, manufacturers must make modifications to Agile in order to adopt it successfully. Although initial results appear promising, much research is needed to explore this new Agile-Stage-Gate hybrid model, and many research challenges remain.},

The motivation behind the software globalisation is competitive advantage and business profits that it yields to an organisation. Besides, these organisations are facing various challenges due to the distributed nature of the software development. However, software process improvement (SPI) is one of the biggest issues in the domain of global software development (GSD). The aim of this research study is to identify success factors and barriers to assist GSD organisations for successful implementation of SPI program. Accordingly, a systematic literature review approach was adopted to identify the success factors and barriers. A total of nine success factors and six barriers were identified that could impact SPI. Using the criteria of the factors having a frequency {	extgreater}50\% as critical, total four success factors were ranked as critical success factors, i.e. management commitment, staff involvement, allocated resources and pilot projects. Moreover, total four barriers were classified as critical barriers, i.e. lack of resources, inexperienced staff, organisational politics and time pressure.},

The Agile Safety Case forces the applicant to be specific about the quality and safety process together with technical safety aspects, enabling the certification process to be done in parallel with development and enabling the certification body to evaluate the current information at any time in the project. Moving from a waterfall/V-model to an agile model affect several parts of the safety case. Only a few international safety standards, like e.g. EN 5129 (Railway) and ISO 26262 (Automotive), require a safety case to be developed. In the future, we expect that more safety standards will include a safety case approach. The railway safety standard EN 50129 does include a list of topics that can be included in safety cases even for other domains.},

However, despite this growing interest, DevOps is often conflated with agile and continuous deployment approaches of software development. This study compares DevOps with agile, lean and continuous deployment approaches in software development from four perspectives: origin, adoption, implementation and goals. The study also reports on the claimed effects and on the metrics of DevOps used to asses those effects. The research is based on an interpretative analysis of qualitative data from documents describing DevOps and practitioner's responses in a DevOps workshop. Our findings indicate that the DevOps phenomenon originated from continuous deployment as an evolution of agile software development, informed by a lean principles background. It was also concluded that successful adoption of DevOps requires agile software development.},

Such statements, known as Likert items, are named for Rensis Likert whose classic studies of attitude measurement were first published in 1932. Almost from the beginning, methodologists and psychometric scholars have raised questions concerning the number of items deemed necessary to form an attitude scale, the number and meaning of various answer categories, and the appropriate statistical methods to use in analyzing the resulting data. These deliberations are summarized. We conclude that, while continuing research on the meaning and uses of Likert scales is needed, many criticisms directed against their usage are unwarranted. Both Likert items and multi-item scales represent useful means for researchers seeking information on subjects' attitudes.}}

However, it should not be assumed that implementing a well-known agile method for a maintenance department is therefore a trivial endeavour - the maintenance operation differs in some, important respects from development work. Classical accounts of software maintenance emphasise more traditional software engineering processes, whereas recent research accounts of agile maintenance efforts uncritically focus on benefits. In an action research project at Aveva in Denmark we assisted with the optimisation of SCRUM, tailoring the standard process to the immediate needs of the developers. We draw on both theoretical and empirical learning to formulate seven heuristics for maintenance practitioners wishing to go agile.},

Method: The method adopted was a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on studies published from 2002 to 2014. Results: 56 out of 783 papers have been identified as describing agile method tailoring approaches. These studies have been identified as case studies regarding the empirical research, as solution proposals regarding the research type, and as evaluation studies regarding the research validation type. Most of the papers used method engineering to implement tailoring and were not specific to any agile method on their scope. Conclusion: Most of agile methods tailoring research papers proposed or improved a technique, were implemented as case studies analyzing one case in details and validated their findings using evaluation. Method engineering was the base for tailoring, the approaches are independent of agile method and the main criteria used are internal environment and objectives variables.},

	abstract = {OVERVIEW: Product development at manufacturing companies is increasingly complex. Linear product development processes, including the traditional Stage-Gate process, cannot support the iterative cycles and external collaboration that characterize today's product development efforts. Hybrid processes combining elements of Agile and Stage-Gate models offer a more flexible alternative to conventional systems. A comparative case study of seven technology-intensive companies shows how combining Stage-Gate models, at the strategic level, with the Agile method Scrum, implemented at the execution level, can offer performance improvements and other advantages over even improved Stage-Gate processes. The key contribution of this study is a generic Agile/Stage-Gate hybrid process based on best practices as identified in the case companies.},

	abstract = {Purpose While the choices available for project management methodologies have increased significantly, questions remain on whether project managers fully consider their alternatives. When project categorization systems and criteria are not logically matched with project objectives, characteristics and environment, this may provide the key reason for why many software projects are reported to fail to deliver on time, budget or do not give value to the client. The purpose of this paper is to identify and categorize critical success factors (CSFs) and develop a contingency fit model contrasting perspectives of traditional plan-based and agile methodologies. Design/methodology/approach By systematically reviewing the previous literature, a total of 37 CSFs for software development projects are identified from 148 articles, and then categorized into three major CSFs: organizational, team and customer factors. A contingency fit model augments this by highlighting the necessity to match project characteristics and project management methodology to these CSFs. Findings Within the three major categories of CSFs, individual factors are ranked based on how frequently they have been cited in previous studies, overall as well as across the two main project management methodologies (traditional, agile). Differences in these rankings as well as mixed empirical support suggest that previous research may not have adequately theorized when particular CSFs will affect project success and lend support for the hypothesized contingency model between CSFs, project characteristics and project success criteria. Research limitations/implications This research is conceptual and meta-analytic in its focus. A crucial task for future research should be to test the contingency fit model developed using empirical data. There is no broad consensus among researchers and practitioners in categorizing CSFs for software development projects. However, through an extensive search and analysis of the literature on CSFs for software development projects, the research provides greater clarity on the categories of CSFs and how their direct, indirect and moderated effects on project success can be modelled. Practical implications This study proposes a contingency fit model and contributes towards developing a theory for assessing the role of CSFs for project success. While future empirical testing of this conceptual model is essential, it provides an initial step for guiding quantitative data collection, specifies detailed empirical analysis for comparative studies, and is likely to improve clarity in debate. Since previous studies have not rigorously assessed the impact of fit between project characteristics, project environment and project management methodology on project success, additional empirically robust studies will help to clarify contradictory findings that have limited theory development for CSFs of software development projects to date. Originality/value Previous research for software development projects has frequently not fully incorporated contingency as moderation or contingency as fit (traditional vs agile). This research sets out to develop fully a contingency fit perspective on software development project success, through contrasting traditional plan-driven and agile methodologies. To do this, the paper systematically identifies and ranks 37 CSFs for software projects from 148 journal publications and holistically categorizes them as organizational, team, customer and project factors.},

	abstract = {The literature on Small and Medium Enterprises often discusses the emergent nature of the product development processes, however; it often does not address the lack of planning tools within such organizations. We aim to fill the gap in tool support for the planning process, by developing a discrete event simulation model to compute lead times of product development projects. The developed model explicitly captures the various tasks, teams, and developers within a distributed product development setting. Furthermore, it captures the iterative nature of the product development process and specifies the contextual relationships among tasks and among developers. The model was validated on a historical data set, as well as with case data from an ongoing project with a small-sized software firm. The model has been encapsulated into a tool using an easy-to-use desktop and iPad application. This work contributes to the practice of product development by allowing managers to model distributed product development teams, individual developers with varying levels of skills and expertise, as well as analyze and optimize the impact of various product development architectures on completion schedule and cost.},

	abstract = {Context: Effective assessment, comparison, selection and adaptation of software development processes remain an acute problem in Software Engineering practice. The quest for a unified theory which might serve this purpose is ongoing. Objective: To take a first step towards such a theory, with focus on characterising and comparing features of software development process models. Method: We consider a theory of design as problem solving and investigate how it can be applied to characterise and explicate specific process features in well known process models from the literature. The intention is to characterise emerging trade-offs between resource expenditure and risk mitigation, which result from the interplay between process efforts into problem and solution exploration vs. stakeholder validation. The analysis, at this point performed, is purely qualitative, and the treatment of resource expenditure and risk quite abstract. Results: We provide an initial characterisation and comparison of features found in a wide range of process models from the literature, within a design theoretic framework using a single building block -- the Problem Oriented Engineering (POE) Process Pattern -- that allows the characterisation of information flow, the relationship between actors, resource usage and developmental risk. Conclusions: The initial characterisation identifies repeated structure in diverse processes, which allows basic process comparison across models. The interpretations are modular, allowing the possibility of relationships between different process models to be explored. As such, the theory allows for a unified means to characterise and compare systematically key features of different process models. In being of an exploratory nature, the work has a number of limitations, which should be addressed by further research.},

Scrum is the most frequently used agile framework, but it is often reported to be adapted in practice. Objective: Thus, we aim to understand how Scrum is adapted in different contexts and what are the reasons for these changes. Method: Using a structured interview guideline, we interviewed ten German companies about their concrete usage of Scrum and analysed the results qualitatively. Results: All companies vary Scrum in some way. The least variations are in the Sprint length, events, team size and requirements engineering. Many users varied the roles, effort estimations and quality assurance. Conclusions: Many variations constitute a substantial deviation from Scrum as initially proposed. For some of these variations, there are good reasons. Sometimes, however, the variations are a result of a previous non-agile, hierarchical organisation.},

	abstract = {Recognizing that design is at the core of information systems development has led to a design-science research paradigm where differing kinds of knowledge goals give form to differing kinds of knowledge processes within a single study. This paper analyzes knowledge production in design-science research to explain how an endogenous form of pluralism characterizes such studies, making it problematic to associate any design-science study with a single view of knowledge production. Instead, a design-science research study exhibits up to four different modes of reasoning, called genres of inquiry. These genres are derived from two dualities that contrast differing knowledge goals and differing knowledge scope in the knowledge production process. The first duality arises from the sometimes seemingly contradictory knowledge goals of science versus design. The second duality reflects the contradiction between the scope of the knowledge produced, which may be idiographic or nomothetic. The evolutionary and iterative nature of a design-science study compels different knowledge goals and scope at different moments throughout a project. Because of this momentary nature, a single design-science study can be associated with multiple genres of inquiry. This understanding of the variety in the genres of inquiry advances the discourse on the nature of design-science research and the justification and evaluation of its outcomes. Consequently, a corresponding set of criteria for knowledge justification and evaluation is provided for each genre of inquiry.},

We undertook a thematic analysis of 193 agile challenges collected at a series of agile conferences and events during 2013 and 2014. Participants were mainly practitioners and business representatives along with some academics. The challenges were thematically analysed by separate authors, synthesised, and a list of seven themes and 27 sub-themes was agreed. Themes were Organisation, Sustainability, Culture, Teams, Scale, Value and Claims and Limitations. We compare our findings against previous attempts to identify and categorise agile challenges. While most themes have persisted we found a shift of focus towards sustainability, business engagement and transformation, as well as claims and limitations.

	abstract = {Although challenges in Global Software Development (GSD) are now well known, companies are still looking for workable solutions to issues relating to poor communication, lack of control, low staff morale, and ambiguous requirements, all of which are prevalent in distributed development settings. Solutions offered are often difficult to implement, are disparate, and can be theoretical rather than practical. We conducted a case study with a GSD company, currently using a plan driven approach to development, and uncovered many GSD problems. We mapped each problem to solutions known to work in Agile development settings. Although work has been undertaken in Agile for GSD, we look to the literature to identify practices that specifically address challenges for organisations already engaged in GSD, who are open to moving from a plan-driven/waterfall development process to a more agile approach. Many challenges are addressed by Agile practices, for example requirements ambiguity, need for autonomy, or unpredictable customer expectations. We hypothesise that many GSD problems can be solved by organisations taking an agile approach to their development.},

	abstract = {The design of embedded systems is being challenged by their growing complexity and tight performance requirements. This paper presents the COMPLEX UML/MARTE Design Space Exploration methodology, an approach based on a novel combination of Model Driven Engineering (MDE), Electronic System Level (ESL) and design exploration technologies. The proposed framework enables capturing the set of possible design solutions, that is, the design space, in an abstract, standard and graphical way by relying on UML and the standard MARTE profile. From that UML/MARTE based model, the automated generation framework proposed produces an executable, configurable and fast performance model which includes functional code of the application components. This generated model integrates an XML-based interface for communication with the tool which steers the exploration. This way, the DSE loop iterations are efficiently performed, without user intervention, avoiding slow manual editions, or regeneration of the performance model. The novel DSE suited modelling features of the methodology are shown in detail. The paper also presents the performance model generation framework, including the enhancements with regard the previous simulation and estimation technology, and the exploration technology. The paper uses an EFR vocoder system example for showing the methodology and for demonstrative results.},

Now, we're seeing new approaches emerging from progressive companies that represent a new generation of idea-to-launch processes. In some cases, it's an evolution of Stage-Gate to a better, faster model; in other firms, its closer to a revolution, moving to a very different system. But there is anything but unanimity as to what the next generation idea-to-launch system should be. This article looks at what leading firms are doing to move beyond their current idea-to-launch methodology and tries to integrate these practices into a next-generation system.},

	abstract = {Continuous software process improvement (SPI) practices have been extensively prescribed to improve performance of software projects. However, SPI implementation mechanisms have received little scholarly attention, especially in the context of distributed software product development. We took an action research approach to study the SPI journey of a large multinational enterprise that adopted a distributed product development strategy. We describe the interventions and action research cycles enacted over a period of five years in collaboration with the firm, which resulted in a custom SPI framework that catered to both the social and technical needs of the firm's distributed teams. Institutionalizing the process maturity framework got stalled initially because the SPI initiatives were perceived by product line managers as a mechanism for exercising wider controls by the firm's top management. The implementation mechanism was subsequently altered to co-opt product line managers, which contributed to a wider adoption of the SPI framework. Insights that emerge from our analysis of the firm's SPI journey pertain to the integration of the technical and social views of software development, preserving process diversity through the use of a multi-tiered, non-blueprint approach to SPI, the linkage between key process areas and project control modes, and the role of SPI in aiding organizational learning.},

	abstract = {Project management methodology is usually defined as a set of methods, techniques, procedures, rules, templates, and best practices used on a project. It is commonly based on a specific project management approach, that defines a set of principles and guidelines which define the way a project is managed. With the growing trend of usage of agile project management on different projects, it is clear that two opposite sides exist -- traditional and agile project management approach, and that there exists a need to combine both approaches. So, the question is if it is and how it is possible to combine both approaches in a single project management methodology? The paper covers thorough literature review and starts with the definition of the project management approach and of the project management methodology. It provides overview of different project management approaches and defines project management methodologies. The literature review shows what is considered as part of project management methodology in a wider or narrower sense, and what the main characteristics of a methodology are. The need for combining project management approaches is shown on the case of software development project. The paper provides basis for further research on application of different project management approaches and methodologies. Further research could build on an idea of creating unique methodology for project, based on different project management approaches. In that way it is possible to create project management methodologies that have high possibility of customization to projects and to project environments.},

Highly volatile requirements of mobile applications require adaptive software development methods. The Agile approach is seen as 
a natural fit for mobile application and there is a need to explore various Agile methodologies for the development of mobile applications. This paper evaluates how adopting various Agile approaches improves the development of mobile applications and if they can be used in order to provide more tailor-made process improvements within an organization. A survey related to mobile application development process improvement was developed. The use of various Agile approaches for success in mobile application development were evaluated by determining the significance of the most used Agile engineering paradigms such as XP, Scrum, and Lean. The findings of the study show that these
Agile methods have the potential to help deliver enhanced speed and quality for mobile application development.},

However, developers of safety critical software often have concerns about adopting agile practices. Through performing a literature review, this research has identified the perceived barriers to following agile practices when developing medical device software. A questionnaire-based survey was also conducted with medical device software developers in Ireland to determine the barriers to adopting agile practices. The survey revealed that half of the respondents develop software in accordance with a plan-driven software development lifecycle and that they believe that there are a number of perceived barriers to adopting agile practices when developing regulatory compliant software such as being contradictory to regulatory requirements, insufficient coverage of risk management activities and the lack of up-front planning. In addition, a comparison is performed between the perceived and actual barriers. Based upon the findings of the literature review and survey, it emerged that no external barriers exist to adopting agile practices when developing medical device software and the barriers that do exists are internal barriers such as getting stakeholder buy in.

	abstract = {Understanding and dealing with the unknown is a major challenge in project management. An extensive body of knowledge---theory and technique---exists on the \enquote{known unknowns,} i.e., uncertainties which can be described probabilistically and addressed through the conventional techniques of risk management. Although some recent studies have addressed projects where the existence of unknown unknowns (unk unks) is readily apparent or may be assumed given the type of project---e.g., new product development or new process implementation---very little work has been reported with respect to projects in general on how a project manager might assess its vulnerability to unk unks. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework to deal with (i.e., recognize and reduce) knowable unk unks in project management. The framework is supported by insights from a variety of theories, case analyses, and experiences. In this framework, we first present a model of the key factors---relating to both project design and behavioral issues---that increase the likelihood of unk unks and a set of propositions linking these factors to unk unks. We then present a set of design and behavioral approaches that project managers could adopt to reduce knowable unk unks. Our framework fills a gap in the project management literature and makes a significant practical contribution: it helps project managers diagnose a project to recognize and reduce the likelihood of unk unks and thus deal more effectively with the otherwise unrecognized risks and opportunities.},

We argue that special attention needs to be paid to ensuring the validity of such studies. This paper makes three contributions to IS research. First, it introduces the concept of instantiation validity as broadly applicable to IS design research, and distinct from existing notions of validity. Second, the paper identifies several sources of instantiation validity threats that can arise in IS design research. Third, it points to the need for guidelines to address these threats and demonstrate validity in design research.},

unconsciously tend to fit their studies in one of the framework set up by either of these approaches. This paper
develops arguments in the perspective of paradigmatic issues in research to highlight the comparatively young
paradigm of critical theory which has not yet gained due projection. The discussion informs on how critical
approach to research may gain equally, or even more, valuable insight not only by analyzing and exploring the
situation but also by offering a change agenda for reformation. The paper also appraises one of the critical research tools, critical discourse analysis in depth, to elaborate the philosophical and theoretical basis of this research methodology in order to enhance awareness among novice researchers investigating under the umbrella of critical paradigm.}}

	abstract = {There is a wide area of applications that use embedded systems, and the number of such systems keeps growing. The required functionality and complexity of embedded systems are also constantly increasing, and development of such products is becoming increasingly harder. This requires new thinking on the product development processes, and one such emerging philosophy is the agile methods. These methods were created by the software engineering community where they are commonly used. Since then, they have been adopted in embedded systems development; however, whether they can improve the embedded systems product development processes remains an open question. This study aims to bring forth what is known about agile methods in embedded systems development and to find out if agile practices are suitable in this domain and what evidence is there to support the findings. We conducted a literature review and a mapping study to answer these questions. The scope of this study is not only limited to embedded software development, but also to embedded hardware and integrated circuits. We have found that agile methods can be used in the embedded domain, but the methods and practices need to be adapted to suit the more constrained field of embedded product development. Furthermore, the field of embedded product development has wide diversity of products with different needs and domain-specific problems so that no single method is applicable, but rather many methods and practices are needed for different situations.},

The company develops, delivers and supports a complex software system with tailored hardware components and unique end-customer installations. By applying the domain knowledge from operations management on lead time reduction and its multiple benefits to process performance, the workflows of globally distributed software development and multitier support processes were measured and monitored throughout the company. The results show that the global end-to-end process visibility and centrally managed reporting at all levels of the organization catalyzed a change process toward significantly better performance. Due to the new performance indicators based on lead times and their variation with fixed control procedures, the case company was able to report faster bug-fixing cycle times, improved response times and generally better customer satisfaction in its global operations. In all, lead times to implement new features and to respond to customer issues and requests were reduced by 50\%. Copyright {\copyright} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the rate of success for IT projects using agile and standard project management methodologies. Any successful project requires use of project methodology. Specifically, large projects require formal project management methodologies or models, which establish a blueprint of processes and project planning activities. This study asked what methodologies should be utilized to improve the chances of project success, as project managers are engaged in decision making. A deficiency in reliability and consistency correlate to a lower success rate of projects. The objective of this quantitative study was to relate the use of the agile or waterfall methodologies and specific critical success factors (CSFs) to IT project success for a sample of IT project managers who have used these methodologies. The results of the analysis of variance showed that there were significant differences between the extent of use of effective communications, user involvement, and use of a quality plan between the models. The results of the Pearson's correlation test showed that project success is significantly and positively associated with effective communication, user involvement, and use of a quality plan in the agile methodology. In addition, the results of the Pearson's correlation test showed that project success is significantly and positively associated with only effective communication and use of a quality plan in the waterfall methodology. Lastly, the results of multiple linear regression analysis showed that none of the CSFs of effective communication, use of quality plan, and user involvement significantly influences the success of the project in both the agile and waterfall project management models.},

These include gated vs. serialized processes, comprehensive vs. incremental system design, independent vs. dependent fabrication, up-front definition vs. continuous validation, and finish-to-start vs. finish-to-finish planning and execution.

Such work can help develop rich insights into various phenomena of interest that cannot be fully understood using only a quantitative or a qualitative method. Notwithstanding the benefits and repeated calls for such work, there is a dearth of mixed methods research in information systems. Building on the literature on recent methodological advances in mixed methods research, we develop a set of guidelines for conducting mixed methods research in IS. We particularly elaborate on three important aspects of conducting mixed methods research: (1) appropriateness of a mixed methods approach; (2) development of meta-inferences (i.e., substantive theory) from mixed methods research; and (3) assessment of the quality of meta-inferences (i.e., validation of mixed methods research). The applicability of these guidelines is illustrated using two published IS papers that used mixed methods.},

	abstract = {The Multi Mission Bus Demonstrator (MBD) is a successful demonstration of agile program management and system engineering in a high risk technology application where utilizing and implementing new, untraditional development strategies were necessary. MBD produced two fully functioning spacecraft for a military/DOD application in a record breaking time frame and at dramatically reduced costs. This paper discloses the adaptation and application of concepts developed in agile software engineering to hardware product and system development for critical military applications. This challenging spacecraft did not use existing key technology (heritage hardware) and created a large paradigm shift from traditional spacecraft development. The insertion of new technologies and methods in space hardware has long been a problem due to long build times, the desire to use heritage hardware, and lack of effective process. The role of momentum in the innovative process can be exploited to tackle ongoing technology disruptions and allowing risk interactions to be mitigated in a disciplined manner. Examples of how these concepts were used during the MBD program will be delineated. Maintaining project momentum was essential to assess the constant non recurring technological challenges which needed to be retired rapidly from the engineering risk liens. Development never slowed due to tactical assessment of the hardware with the adoption of the SCRUM technique. We adapted this concept as a representation of mitigation of technical risk while allowing for design freeze later in the program's development cycle. By using Agile Systems Engineering and Management techniques which enabled decisive action, the product development momentum effectively was used to produce two novel space vehicles in a fraction of time with dramatically reduced cost.},

	abstract = {Earlier empirical studies have demonstrated the interest that agile methods have generated in the software industry. Currently, lean approaches are increasingly adopted for complementing agile methods in software processes. With the goal of providing up-to-day results that can be used by organizations implementing or planning to implement agile and/or lean methods, we have conducted a study on the current stage of agile and lean adoption and usage in the software industry. For this purpose, we conducted an extensive survey among Finnish software practitioners in 2011, using the membership registry of The Finnish Information Processing Association (FIPA) as a sampling frame. 408 responses were collected from 200 software intensive organizations in the study. The survey included questions for identifying the rate of agile and lean usage in software organizations as well as the implementation of specific methods and practices, goals in adopting agile and lean, reasons for not applying these methods and effects of the agile and lean usage. The results of the survey reveal that a majority of respondents' organizational units are using agile and/or lean methods (58\%). Furthermore, lean appears as a new player, being used by 24\% of respondents, mainly in combination with agile (21\%). The reasons and benefits for using agile and lean methods appeared to correspond in most parts to the findings of the earlier research. Generally, the experiences of using agile and lean methods seem to be rather positive, although challenges, such as obtaining management support and limitations for scaling agile in distributed settings, were also identified.},

	abstract = {An optimal software development process is regarded as being dependent on the situational characteristics of individual software development settings. Such characteristics include the nature of the application(s) under development, team size, requirements volatility and personnel experience. However, no comprehensive reference framework of the situational factors affecting the software development process is presently available.
The absence of such a comprehensive reference framework of the situational factors affecting the software development process is problematic not just because it inhibits our ability to optimise the software development process, but perhaps more importantly, because it potentially undermines our capacity to ascertain the key constraints and characteristics of a software development setting.
To address this deficiency, we have consolidated a substantial body of related research into an initial reference framework of the situational factors affecting the software development process. To support the data consolidation, we have applied rigorous data coding techniques from Grounded Theory and we believe that the resulting framework represents an important contribution to the software engineering field of knowledge.
The resulting reference framework of situational factors consists of eight classifications and 44 factors that inform the software process. We believe that the situational factor reference framework presented herein represents a sound initial reference framework for the key situational elements affecting the software process definition.
In addition to providing a useful reference listing for the research community and for committees engaged in the development of standards, the reference framework also provides support for practitioners who are challenged with defining and maintaining software development processes. Furthermore, this framework can be used to develop a profile of the situational characteristics of a software development setting, which in turn provides a sound foundation for software development process definition and optimisation.},

	abstract = {Embedded systems are widely used in diverse areas, such as avionics, consumer electronics, and medical equipments, causing a considerable impact on modern society. Since these systems sometimes deal directly with human lives, and require a considerable level of quality, their development should be subject to a rigorous process. In another perspective, agile methods (or agile processes) have been adopted by the software industry as a lightweight, iterative, and collaborative approach for developing software systems. Although agile methods do not seem to be suitable to embedded systems, they have been successfully used for building such systems. However, there exists no detailed and analytical overview of the use of such methods in the embedded systems domain. The main objective of this paper is to present a detailed view of how agile methods have been used in the development of embedded systems, and to describe their benefits, challenges, and limitations. For this, we have applied Systematic Review, a technique for systematically exploring, organizing, summarizing, and assessing potentially all works conducted in a specific research area. As the main result, we have observed that agile methods have brought advantages to embedded systems development; however, more studies should be conducted. Furthermore, this work is also intended to contribute to the identification of important new research lines.},

Here we find and review 148 DS research articles published in a selected set of information systems (IS), computer science (CS) and engineering journals. We analyze the articles to develop taxonomies of DS artifact types and artifact evaluation methods; we apply these taxonomies to determine which evaluation methods are associated in the literature with particular artifacts. We show that there are several popular \enquote{artifact - evaluation method} combinations in the literature.

However, in recent decades a series of methodologies have emerged, called "agile methodologies", which aim to develop software quickly, focusing on people and frequent delivery of software. Of the existing agile methodologies, Scrum is one of the most widely-applied, due to its ability to complement other methods and processes. For this reason, the strategies proposed by Scrum may be suitable for the distributed management and deployment of the phases and disciplines of RUP. In this paper we present a methodology based on the integration of RUP and Scrum, called scrum UP, which has been so designed as to be appropriate in a distributed environment.},

	abstract = {Context
Many organizations have started to deploy agile methods, but so far there exist only a few studies on organization-wide transformations. Are agile methods here to stay? Some claim that agile software development methods are in the mainstream adoption phase in the software industry, while others hope that those are a passing fad. The assumption here is that if agile would not provide real improvement, adopters would be eager at first but turn pessimistic after putting it into practice.
Objective
Despite the growing amount of anecdotal evidence on the success of agile methods across a wide range of different real-life development settings, scientific studies remain scarce. Even less is known about the perception of the impacts of agile transformation when it is deployed in a very large software development environment, and whether agile methods are here to stay. This study aims to fill that gap by providing evidence from a large-scale agile transformation within Nokia. While we have yet to confirm these findings with solid quantitative data, we believe that the perception of the impacts already pinpoints the direction of the impacts of large-scale agile transformation.
Method
The data were collected using a questionnaire. The population of the study contains more than 1000 respondents in seven different countries in Europe, North America, and Asia.
Results
The results reveal that most respondents agree on all accounts with the generally claimed benefits of agile methods. These benefits include higher satisfaction, a feeling of effectiveness, increased quality and transparency, increased autonomy and happiness, and earlier detection of defects. Finally, 60\% of respondents would not like to return to the old way of working.
Conclusion
While the perception of the impact of agile methods is predominantly positive, several challenge areas were discovered. However, based on this study, agile methods are here to stay.},

	abstract = {So far, only few in-depth studies focused on the direct comparison of process models in general, and between plan-driven and incremental/agile approaches in particular. That is, it is not made explicit what the effect is of moving from one model to another model. Furthermore, there is limited evidence on advantages and issues encountered in agile software development, this is specifically true in the context of large-scale development. The objective of the paper is to investigate how the perception of bottlenecks, unnecessary work, and rework (from hereon referred to as issues) changes when migrating from a plan-driven to an incremental software development approach with agile practices (flexible product backlog, face-to-face interaction, and frequent integration), and how commonly perceived these practices are across different systems and development roles. The context in which the objective should be achieved is large-scale development with a market-driven focus. The selection of the context was based on the observation in related work that mostly small software development projects were investigated and that the investigation was focused on one agile model (eXtreme programming). A case study was conducted at a development site of Ericsson AB, located in Sweden in the end of 2007. In total 33 interviews were conducted in order to investigate the perceived change when migrating from plan-driven to incremental and agile software development, the interviews being the primary source of evidence. For triangulation purposes measurements collected by Ericsson were considered, the measurements relating to unnecessary work (amount of discarded requirements) and rework (data on testing efficiency and maintenance effort). Triangulation in this context means that the measurements were used to confirm the perceived changes with an additional data source. In total 64 issues were identified, 24 being of general nature and the remaining 40 being local and therefore unique to individual's opinions or a specific system. The most common ones were documented and analyzed in detail. The commonality refers to how many persons in different roles and across the systems studied have mentioned the issues for each of the process models. The majority of the most common issues relates to plan-driven development. We also identified common issues remaining for agile after the migration, which were related to testing lead-time, test coverage, software release, and coordination overhead. Improvements were identified as many issues commonly raised for the plan-driven approach were not raised anymore for the incremental and agile approach. It is concluded that the recent introduction (start in 2005 with the study being conducted in the end of 2007) of incremental and agile practices brings added values in comparison to the plan-driven approach, which is evident from the absence of critical issues that are encountered in plan-driven development.},

	abstract = {Given the plethora of advantages attributed to agile methodologies, why are there only infrequent reports of their application in the embedded systems world? We believe this has two principal causes. First, embedded applications go through a life cycle that differs from desktop life cycles, so that desktop application production processes must be significantly altered to meet the demands of this new domain. Second, without providing for full life-cycle tool support, no change to embedded production processes will ever succeed, and again desktop tools must be adapted to meet the new environment's constraints. Here, the authors discuss their thoughts on an XP-inspired embedded life cycle and their successes in developing, extending, and using embedded test-driven development frameworks for customers (Matlab-Fit and Embedded-FitNesse) and developers (MUnit and Embedded-Unit).

Software process tailoring is the activity of tuning a process to meet the needs of a specific project. Despite the critical role that tailoring software processes plays in ensuring project success, few guidelines on it are available for practitioners. The authors conducted an empirical study in two organizations and developed a framework to guide process tailoring. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {In recent years, discrete control systems play an important role in the development and advancement of modern civilization and technology. Practically every aspect of our life is affected by some type of control systems. This kind of system maybe classified as an embedded real-time system and requires rigorous methodologies to develop the software that is under stringent hardware constraints. Therefore, the proposed development methodology adapts agile principles and patterns in order to build embedded control systems focusing on the issues related to the system's constraints and safety. Strong unit testing is the foundation of the proposed methodology for ensuring timeliness and correctness. Moreover, platform-based design approach is used to balance costs and time-to-market in view of performance and functionality constraints. We conclude that the proposed methodology reduces significantly the design time and cost as well as leads to better software modularity and reliability.},

The unique requirements and constraints associated with mobile systems have brought new challenges to software development for such environments, as it demands extensive improvements to traditional systems development methodologies in order to fulfill the special needs of this field. We examine the challenges of developing software for mobile systems, starting by reviewing mobile systemspsila characteristics and investigating the status quo of mobile software development methods. It has been shown that Agile methodologies are appropriate methods for the development of such systems; based on this assumption, we identify specific requirements for a mobile software development methodology, based on which a new agile method is engineered using the Hybrid Methodology Design approach. We claim that this methodology, and the approach used for its construction, can facilitate the application of a software engineering approach to the production of mobile software systems.},

	abstract = {Stage-Gate has become a popular system for driving new products to market, and the benefits of using such a robust idea-to-launch system have been well documented. However, there are many misconceptions and challenges in using Stage-Gate. First, Stage-Gate is briefly outlined, noting how the system should work and the structure of both stages and gates. Next, some of the misconceptions about Stage-Gate---it is not a linear process, nor is it a rigid system---are debunked, and explanations of what Stage-Gate is and is not are provided. The challenges faced in employing Stage-Gate are identified, including governance issues, overbureaucratizing the process, and misapplying cost-cutting systems such as Six Sigma and Lean Manufacturing to product innovation. Solutions are offered, including better governance methods such as \enquote{gates with teeth,} clearly defined gatekeepers, and gatekeeper rules of engagement, as well as ways to deal with bureaucracy, including leaner gates. Next-generation versions of Stage-Gate are introduced, notably a scalable system (to handle many different types and sizes of projects), as well as even more flexible and adaptable versions of Stage-Gate achieved via spiral development and simultaneous execution. Additionally, Stage-Gate now incorporates better decision-making practices including scorecards, success criteria, self-managed gates, electronic and virtual gates, and integration with portfolio management. Improved accountability and continuous improvement are now built into Stage-Gate via a rigorous postlaunch review. Finally, progressive companies are reinventing Stage-Gate for use with \enquote{open innovation,} whereas others are applying the principles of value stream analysis to yield a leaner version of Stage-Gate.},

	abstract = {The paper motivates, presents, demonstrates in use, and evaluates a methodology for conducting design science (DS) research in information systems (IS). DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},

	abstract = {Surveys are consistently used to measure quality. Likert scales are a common ratings format for surveys. Statisticians have generally grouped data collected from these surveys into a hierarchy of four levels of measurement: 1. nominal data, 2. ordinal data, 3. interval data, and 4. ratio data. Likert scales were developed in 1932 as the familiar five-point bipolar response that most people are familiar with today. Your initial analysis of Likert scalar data should not involve parametric statistics but should rely on the ordinal nature of the data. While Likert scale variables usually represent an underlying continuous measure, analysis of individual items should use parametric procedures only as a pilot analysis. Combining Likert scales into indexes adds values and variability to the data. Finally, converting a five or seven category instrument to a continuous variable is possible with a calibrated line or track bar.},

We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.},

It is rare for such a project to be staffed with newbies but it happened, and this paper tells the story. It is also rare for an agile project to have substantial hard numbers to tell its story but this one does. This paper presents detailed metrics from a three year long agile project where a newly formed development team produced a new embedded software product from scratch. The team experimented with various agile practices while recording data on bug rates, bug root causes, code size, schedule compliance, and labor expended. Although most of the team members lacked important technical skills for this work, they outperformed far more experienced teams. The natural learning environment and safety net that agile provides allowed them to learn fast while keeping them from serious mistakes},

However, similar practices for embedded systems, particularly in resource constrained systems, have not yet become prevalent. Today, quality in embedded software is generally tied to platform-specific testing tools geared towards debugging. We present here an integrated collection of concrete concepts and practices that are decoupled from platform-specific tools. In fact, our approach drives the actual design of embedded software. These strategies yield good design, systems that are testable under automation, and a significant reduction in software flaws. Examples from an 8 bit system with 16k of program memory and 255 bytes of RAM illustrate these ideas},

	abstract = {Despite the much-ballyhooed increase in outsourcing, most companies are in do-it-yourself mode for the bulk of their processes, in large part because there's no way to compare outside organizations' capabilities with those of internal functions. Given the lack of comparability, it's almost surprising that anyone outsources today. But it's not surprising that cost is by far companies' primary criterion for evaluating outsourcers or that many companies are dissatisfied with their outsourcing relationships. A new world is coming, says the author, and it will lead to dramatic changes in the shape and structure of corporations. A broad set of process standards will soon make it easy to determine whether a business capability can be improved by outsourcing it. Such standards will also help businesses compare service providers and evaluate the costs versus the benefits of outsourcing. Eventually these costs and benefits will be so visible to buyers that outsourced processes will become a commodity, and prices will drop significantly. The low costs and low risk of outsourcing will accelerate the flow of jobs offshore, force companies to reassess their strategies, and change the basis of competition. The speed with which some businesses have already adopted process standards suggests that many previously unscrutinized areas are ripe for change. In the field of technology, for instance, the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute has developed a global standard for software development processes, called the Capability Maturity Model (CMM). For companies that don't have process standards in place, it makes sense for them to create standards by working with customers, competitors, software providers, businesses that processes may be outsourced to, and objective researchers and standard-setters. Setting standards is likely to lead to the improvement of both internal and outsourced processes.},

Focusing more on continuous improvement in code development processes, generic-process frameworks such as the CMM lack key process areas (KPA) that address capabilities for managing distributed software projects, such as establishing mutual knowledge and managing geographically dispersed social networks. We identify 24 new KPAs that address the wide-ranging capabilities needed for managing distributed software development and arrange them in an evolutionary order similar to the CMM framework. The evolutionary or phased approach in improving software management capabilities helps firms systematically assess their situations and plan for improvements. We also report the results of a statistically tested maturity assessment survey and test the overall rigor of our model against industry expert opinion and objective data collected from real-world projects implemented at SAP AG, a leading global-enterprise software firm.},

Focusing more on continuous improvement in code development processes, generic-process frameworks such as the CMM lack key process areas (KPA) that address capabilities for managing distributed software projects, such as establishing mutual knowledge and managing geographically dispersed social networks. We identify 24 new KPAs that address the wide-ranging capabilities needed for managing distributed software development and arrange them in an evolutionary order similar to the CMM framework. The evolutionary or phased approach in improving software management capabilities helps firms systematically assess their situations and plan for improvements. We also report the results of a statistically tested maturity assessment survey and test the overall rigor of our model against industry expert opinion and objective data collected from real-world projects implemented at SAP AG, a leading global-enterprise software firm.},

	abstract = {Global software development has become an extremely important issue for organizations at present in the climate of increasing tendency towards globalization and global outsourcing. A number of studies have been conducted which have identified a set of problematic-areas which are common across projects, including language and cultural differences, trust factors, communication across temporal and spatial distances, lack of shared contextual awareness. This study of global software development at Analog Devices Inc. (ADI) is especially noteworthy for a number of reasons. Firstly, the project has recently moved from a co-located to a globally-distributed one, and thus the team had already had experience of being co-located a factor that has not typically been the case in the studies published to date where teams are being established who have not previously been co-located. Also, as language and cultural factors were not an issue, the study was able to focus on the problems of communication over temporal and spatial distances. The study discusses how ADI attempted to address these problems and identifies the initiatives that worked well, and, more importantly, those that did not work as well. Among the findings was the fact that trust, which had been very solidly established among team members during co-location, was significantly eroded as the project team was reconstituted on a distributed basis.},
	annote = {Concluded that trust which had been established when team was colocated was significantly eroded when the team became distributed.
After 4 months, reduced productivity, morale and trust between the distributed teams.
 
Conclusions
Negative

communication tools not as effective as hoped (for conversations and meetings) [Hence toolsuite is key to distributed development]
communication levels did not meet co-located levels.
remote experts led to productivity and trust problems - with colated experts developer more likely to ask for help and an issue resolved in minutes, and the problem understood. If the expert is remote, less likely to be contacted (especially if temporal difference), harder to communicate, and issue can take hours or days to resolve.
Time zone differences led to productivity loss.

 
Positive Observations

Friendships did positively support communications between remote teams.

 
Conclusions

there is an overhead in communication between remotely distributed teams.
Processes need to be inplace to support effective co-ordination and communication (for example developer weekly reports, need for report visible to all when committing code changes (so everyone knows what is happening),  toolsuite to communication.

The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.},

	abstract = {Aim. This paper discusses the literature on establishing rigour in research studies. It describes the methodological trinity of reliability, validity and generalization and explores some of the issues relating to establishing rigour in naturalistic inquiry. Background. Those working within the naturalistic paradigm have questioned the issue of using validity, reliability and generalizability to demonstrate robustness of qualitative research. Triangulation has been used to demonstrate confirmability and completeness and has been one means of ensuring acceptability across paradigms. Emerging criteria such as goodness and trustworthiness can be used to evaluate the robustness of naturalistic inquiry. Discussion. It is argued that the transference of terms across paradigms is inappropriate; however, if we reject the concepts of validity and reliability, we reject the concept of rigour. Rejection of rigour undermines acceptance of qualitative research as a systematic process that can contribute to the advancement of knowledge. Emerging criteria for demonstrating robustness in qualitative inquiry, such as authenticity, trustworthiness and goodness, need to be considered. Goodness, when not seen as a separate construct but as an integral and embedded component of the research process, should be useful in assuring quality of the entire study. Triangulation is a tried and tested means of offering completeness, particularly in mixed-method research. When multiple types of triangulation are used appropriately as the `triangulation state of mind', they approach the concept of crystallization, which allows for infinite variety of angles of approach. Conclusion. Qualitative researchers need to be explicit about how and why they choose specific legitimizing criteria in ensuring the robustness of their inquiries. A shift from a position of fundamentalism to a more pluralistic approach as a means of legitimizing naturalistic inquiry is advocated.},

So, you might expect that this domain would employ specific software development technologies. An inventory conducted at several European embedded-software-development companies shows that, remarkably, this isn\&rsquo;t true. However, the inventory results concerning requirements engineering and architecture design at these companies suggest that more specifically aimed development technologies are necessary.

	abstract = {Agile software development methods have caught the attention of software engineers and researchers worldwide. Scientific research is yet scarce. This paper reports results from a study, which aims to organize, analyze and make sense out of the dispersed field of agile software development methods. The comparative analysis is performed using the method's life-cycle coverage, project management support, type of practical guidance, fitness-for-use and empirical evidence as the analytical lenses. The results show that agile software development methods, without rationalization, cover certain/different phases of the software development life-cycle and most of them do not offer adequate support for project management. Yet, many methods still attempt to strive for universal solutions (as opposed to situation appropriate) and the empirical evidence is still very limited. Based on the results, new directions are suggested In principal, it is suggested to place emphasis on methodological quality - not method quantity.},

	abstract = {One purpose of empirical software engineering is to enable an understanding of factors that influence software development. Surveys are an appropriate empirical strategy to gather data from a large population (e.g., about methods, tools, developers, companies) and to achieve an understanding of that population. Although surveys are quite often performed, for example, in social sciences and marketing research, they are underrepresented in empirical software engineering research, which most often uses controlled experiments and case studies. Consequently, also the methodological support how to perform such studies in software engineering is rather low. However, with the increasing pervasion of the Internet it is possible to perform surveys easily and cost-effectively over Internet pages (i.e., on-line), while at the same time the interest in performing surveys is growing. The purpose of this paper is twofold. First we want to arise the awareness of on-line surveys and discuss methods how to perform these in the context of software engineering. Second, we report our experience in performing on-line surveys in the form of lessons learned and guidelines.},

	abstract = {Agile software development methods have been suggested as useful in many situations and contexts. However, only few (if any) experiences are available regarding the use of agile methods in embedded domain where the hardware sets tight requirements for the software. This development domain is arguably far away from the agile home ground. This paper explores the possibility of using agile development techniques in this environment and defines the requirements for new agile methods targeted to facilitate the development of embedded software. The findings are based on an empirical study over a period 12 months in the development of low-level telecommunications software. We maintain that by addressing the requirements we discovered, agile methods can be successful also in the embedded software domain.},

	abstract = {Although many of their advocates consider the agile and plan-driven software development methods polar opposites, synthesizing the two can provide developers with a comprehensive spectrum of tools and options. Real-world examples argue for and against agile methods. Responding to change has been cited as the critical technical success factor in the Internet browser battle between Microsoft and Netscape. But overresponding to change has been cited as the source of many software disasters, such as the \$3 billion overrun of the US Federal Aviation Administration's Advanced Automation System for national air traffic control. The author believes that both agile and plan-driven approaches have a responsible center and overinterpreting radical fringes. Agile and plan-driven methods both form part of the planning spectrum. Thus, while each approach has a home ground within which it performs very well, and much better than the other, a combined approach is feasible and preferable in some circumstances.},

Activities in this new stage include: building in an idea capture and handling system; doing voice of customer research work, including "camping out" with customers and working with innovative users; generating scenarios; and holding major revenuegenerating events. Best-practice companies are also harnessing fundamental research more effectively by implementing a novel stage-gate approach.},

This added focus has added a new layer of complexity to an already challenging area of research. Along with new research questions, new research methods are needed to study nontechnical aspects of software engineering. In many other disciplines, qualitative research methods have been developed and are commonly used to handle the complexity of issues involving human behavior. This paper presents several qualitative methods for data collection and analysis and describes them in terms of how they might be incorporated into empirical studies of software engineering, in particular how they might be combined with quantitative methods. To illustrate this use of qualitative methods, examples from real software engineering studies are used throughout.},

	abstract = {It is increasingly common for someone actively seeking a job online to come across appealing but fake ads offering high wages, flexible hours, teleworking and career growth opportunities. Usually, job ads with such favourable conditions are examples of Online Recruitment Fraud (ORF) which attempt to collect unsuspecting candidates' personal information. ORF is a relatively new field of variable severity that can escalate quickly to extensive scams. Corporate hiring has recently been ported to the cloud. However, this has fuelled a new type of online scam that jeopardises job seekers' privacy and harms the reputation of organisations. Employment scams share common characteristics with others, such as email spam and phishing, but also have their own peculiarities. Sokratis Vidros and Georgios Kambourakis of the University of the Aegean, Greece and Constantinos Kolias of George Mason University, US present a preliminary analysis of real-life fraudulent job ads.},

	abstract = {Hybrid logics are a principled generalization of both modal logics and description logics, a standard formalism for knowledge representation. In this paper we give the first constructive version of hybrid logic, thereby showing that it is possible to hybridize constructive modal logics. Alternative systems are discussed, but we fix on a reasonable and well-motivated version of intuitionistic hybrid logic and prove essential proof-theoretical results for a natural deduction formulation of it. Our natural deduction system is also extended with additional inference rules corresponding to conditions on the accessibility relations expressed by so-called geometric theories. Thus, we give natural deduction systems in a uniform way for a wide class of constructive hybrid logics. This shows that constructive hybrid logics are a viable enterprise and opens up the way for future applications.},

	abstract = {When considering today's uncertain atmosphere, many people and organizations believe that strategy has lost its meaning and position. When future is predictable, common approaches for strategic planning are applicable; nonetheless, vague circumstances require different methods. Accordingly, a new approach that is compatible with uncertainty and unstable conditions is necessary. Fuzzy logic is a worldview compatible with today complicated requirements. Regarding today's uncertain and vague atmosphere, there is an absolute requirement to fuzzify the tools and strategic planning models, especially for dynamic and unclear environment. In this research, an extended version of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) fuzzy approach has been presented for strategic planning based on fuzzy logic. It has solved the traditional strategic planning key problems like internal and external factors in imprecision and ambiguous environment. The model has been performed in an information technology corporation to demonstrate the capabilities in real world cases.},

Increasingly, scientific breakthroughs will be powered by advanced computing capabilities that help researchers manipulate and explore massive datasets.

The speed at which any given scientific discipline advances will depend on how well its researchers collaborate with one another, and with technologists, in areas of eScience such as databases, workflow management, visualization, and cloud computing technologies.

In The Fourth Paradigm: Data-Intensive Scientific Discovery, the collection of essays expands on the vision of pioneering computer scientist Jim Gray for a new, fourth paradigm of discovery based on data-intensive science and offers insights into how it can be fully realized.
Critical praise for The Fourth Paradigm
``The individual essays---and The Fourth Paradigm as a whole---give readers a glimpse of the horizon for 21st-century research and, at their best, a peek at what lies beyond. It's a journey well worth taking.''
--- James P. Collins
School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University

From the back cover
``The impact of Jim Gray's thinking is continuing to get people to think in a new way about how data and software are redefining what it means to do science."
--- Bill Gates, Chairman, Microsoft Corporation

``I often tell people working in eScience that they aren't in this field because they are visionaries or super-intelligent---it's because they care about science and they are alive now. It is about technology changing the world, and science taking advantage of it, to do more and do better.''
--- Rhys Francis, Australian eResearch Infrastructure Council

\enquote{One of the greatest challenges for 21st-century science is how we respond to this new era of data-intensive science. This is recognized as a new paradigm beyond experimental and theoretical research and computer simulations of natural phenomena---one that requires new tools, techniques, and ways of working.}
--- Douglas Kell, University of Manchester

\enquote{The contributing authors in this volume have done an extraordinary job of helping to refine an understanding of this new paradigm from a variety of disciplinary perspectives.}
--- Gordon Bell, Microsoft Research

	abstract = { Abstract Endurance sports are increasing in popularity and athletes at all levels are looking for ways to optimize their performance by training and nutrition. For endurance exercise lasting 30 min or more, the most likely contributors to fatigue are dehydration and carbohydrate depletion, whereas gastrointestinal problems, hyperthermia, and hyponatraemia can reduce endurance exercise performance and are potentially health threatening, especially in longer events (>4 h). Although high muscle glycogen concentrations at the start may be beneficial for endurance exercise, this does not necessarily have to be achieved by the traditional supercompensation protocol. An individualized nutritional strategy can be developed that aims to deliver carbohydrate to the working muscle at a rate that is dependent on the absolute exercise intensity as well as the duration of the event. Endurance athletes should attempt to minimize dehydration and limit body mass losses through sweating to 2--3\% of body mass. Gastrointestinal problems occur frequently, especially in long-distance races. Problems seem to be highly individual and perhaps genetically determined but may also be related to the intake of highly concentrated carbohydrate solutions, hyperosmotic drinks, as well as the intake of fibre, fat, and protein. Hyponatraemia has occasionally been reported, especially among slower competitors with very high intakes of water or other low sodium drinks. Here I provide a comprehensive overview of recent research findings and suggest several new guidelines for the endurance athlete on the basis of this. These guidelines are more detailed and allow a more individualized approach. },

Page 6: "And that killing of what is alive in things resulted from the need to make them the same for different people, and thus to reach an agreement. For originally the world was different for different people."

Page 6: "The object of isolation of the world in mathematical systems in distinct individuals is kept in mutual connection by the passionless language, which causes the direction of the identical mathematical system in both listener and speaker, although the emotional content of that system can be totally different in both."

Page 8: "when one investigates how mathematical systems come about, one sees that they are constructed out of the Ur-intuition of two-ity. The intuitions of the continuous and discrete join here, as [simply] as second [thing] is thought not by itself, but under preservation of the regulation of the first. The first and the second are thus kept together and the intuition of the continuous (contiere = keeping together) consists of this keeping together. This mathematical Ur-intuition is nothing but the contextless abstraction of the sensation of time. I.e., the sensation of 'fixed' and 'floating' together. Or of 'remaining' and 'changing' together.},

A long paper that identifies three catergories of design activity:
* design definition,

Into these three categories, 28 seperate design activies are placed.

Although the initial premis is questionable (that shared understanding and ontologies are the same thing) the paper is useful in collectig together lots of design terms.

Opportunities:

* the paper confirms a designer-centric view of design.

It talks about circumsrciption, a form of non-monotonic reasoning that augments logic.

Interpretation: the assertions made are the strongest that can be made.

McCarthy gives an example of the assertion:

isblock A or isblock B (Ex)

NB, no isblock A and isblock B

in which case, applying Eq 1 (p.7) gives

forall x : (isblock x => x = A) or forall x : (isblock x => x = B)

i.e., that there is a single block, named either A or B. We do not, by circunscription, reach the conclusion that there are two blocks, as is allowed by (Ex).

Appears to give some sort of closed logical world assumption.},

Precis:

Presents the case that design is not just search, but is -- instead -- exploration. 

The exploration is motivated by the wish to computationalise design, and so the goals are different to ours. 

Quotes:
* p89: summary fo AI `AI research, at least in the form set up by such founding fathers as John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell and Herbert Simon, is based upon the much older scientific tradition of developing syntactic systems of description and explanation of the phenomenal world around us. That is, AI research has joined disciplines like physics, biology, chemistry, computer science and others, in trying to develop a formal understanding of its subject of study. Newton's laws of motion are perhaps among the most familiar examples of a formal understanding describing the dynamics of the world we live in, and general relativity is regarded as being a better formalization. This tradition is essentially Platonic in origin embodying, as it does, the ideal that form is more important than substance.' 
* p90: definition of Natural Law as `In trying to formalize understanding, any scientific enterprise presumes two essential things about the phenomena it seeks to understand.
* The events which characterize the phenomenon in question are fundamentally governed by laws.
* The laws which govern these events are, at least in part, comprehensible by the human mind.
These two assumptions, or beliefs, are what is sometimes called Natural Law.'

* p91: on the relationship between AI and Computer Science: 
`AI is a clearly separated enterprise from that of computing science. For computing science, the computer and computation are the subjects of study, whereas in AI they are the stuff from which experimental systems are created.'

* p91: on the nature of problems:
`It is argued elsewhere, Smithers et al. (1989) and Logan and Smithers (1989), that an essential part of the design process involves discovering the structure of the problem. It is not a process which starts with a well-defined goal, nor is it one which starts with a well-defined problem space.[...] In design tasks, the nature of the problem involved must be discovered as well as its solution. This process of co-discovery is not one divided into two sequential parts: problem discovery, then solution discovery. Discovering the nature of the problem is the means by which a solution is discovered.'

* p95: on the nature of design:
`We agree with Simon's description of the design process as an ill-structured problem, and see some merit in the proposal that computational search forms an essential element of its solution, but we do not agree that this means that the design process is well-characterized as a big search problem, as so many AI in Design researchers have subsequently done.'

Opportunities:

* p90: formalisation of a material system - mapping causality to imference.
* the intent of the article to to move towards a computational theory of design: that's not where we are, but the critique places into sharp relief the difficulties that AI in design faces. hese may be precised by stating that AI see design as search.
* p95: mention of 'goal oriented' as opposed to goal directed.


Described in [* sim2003towards *] as 
`Smithers and Troxell (1990) view design as a process of identifying incompleteness, inconsistency, imprecision, ambiguity and impossibility in requirements statements, modifying and refining these to well-formed problem statements from which to generate good solutions. '},

Contrasting research and design

Research methodology is charatcerised as deductively oriented; that is, it attempts to derive a particular design that logically will follow from the theories. Research, on the other hand, is inductively oriented; that is, it attempts to derive generalizations or hypotheses from many instances and specifics.

Cassidy [6] points out that there are three kinds of major intellectual activities. 
* analysis, which is `the activity of gathering data, describing things as they are, collecting and recording instances, making lists, and so.'
* synthesis, which is `the activity of finding connections between the data made available by the analytical activity, making hypotheses and theories, and developing laws.'; and 
* reduction-to-practice, which is the `activity through which a return is made from the general principle to the single instances.'

Analysis assumes pre-existence of that analysed, focusses on components, and not the whole, is reductionist, needs tools to do so, and these tools are not necessarily available to all.


The research scientist is primarily oriented toward analysis and somewhat toward synthesis. 
The design engineer is primarily oriented toward reduction-to-practice and only slightly toward synthesis.},

`3.2 Rational reconstruction of a practical prob-
lem solving process
The process of solving a practical problem is a sequence of activities and events as they could be written down in the diaries of the problem solvers involved in it. This process does not necessarily follow the regulative cycle. Already in 1971 Bruce Archer remarked that a design process does not start with a statement of requirements, leading up to a specification of a solution unknown at the start of the process [2]. Rather, the practical problem solving process starts with obscurity about the requirements, or about the the practicability of a possible solution, or about the match between requirements and solution; and it leads to a state with a requirements/solution match that contains an accept- ably small amount of residual misfit and obscurity [2, page 17].'}}

Useful quotes:

*  p5: `the existing research [1, 8, 12, 13, 16] [...] typically start with an assumption of a `given' problem specification, and focus on the solution. In other words, they are concerned with solving the problems. In this paper, we made a step towards a more formal conceptual basis of interpreting the problems by solving them.'
* p2.  that constraints and requirements are the same, logically: `From an operational point, it is possible to distinguish design requirements R from design constraints C, and assert that a problem specification is a union of the two -- i.e. S = R [?] C' 
* p2: that frame and framing are undefined: `The first major gap in the existing research is an interpretation and a formal clarification of terms `frame' and `framing'. The empirical evidence suggest that framing is an important reasoning step that precedes the problem solving and complements it [4, 10, 11]. However, what are the implications of `framing' on the knowledge level? What is happening with a designer's knowledge during the problem framing? Can this `framing' be expressed formally? These are some of the challenges we tackle in the further text.'


Questions raised:
* p5: is circumscription the process by which a validatable description is reached? (McCarthy, 1980)
* p4: the call for a proof of an intermediate conjecture is a design task, accepted on this page; why does it terminate? how do we know that the reformulated systems are suitable without reference to a stake-holder?
* p1: is it not the case that this is to do with the intersection between problem and solution spaces, and that requirements and constraints are expressed on what Jackson would call the specification phenomena?


Opportunities:

Problem space is defined, but not in a way we would understand it. (p. 1213)

Architecture, as mentioned, means that of buildings. (p. 1216)

Multiple Stakeholders (although not called that) are accepted. Primary appears to be the customer. (p. 1211)

Co-design is sort of constraint (p. 1212)

Minzberg is mentioned (p.1209)

It may be that there are two approaches possible from this paper: 

1. The lack of organsational 'science' means that representations are not good, and that as we do not know how they function, they are difficult to design. Difficulties with humans make them difficult to 'predict' and 'control'.
2. The paper claims that design is 'too broad' to be [encompassed by unifed general theories that are substantially deep.] How can POE assuge this view?

Tries to distinguish practical problems from knowledge problems. on the grounds that the former changes the world whereas the latter only changes knowledge. However, the latter also have validation criteria in POE, and may change the world by changing the behaviours of those in it.

The internal consistency appears to be close to what the problem proposition is except that:
* it is distant from the stakeholder, asking that E meets C the stake-holder criteria;
* the effects E are not approachable in the real-world, only by proxy, and that proxy (testing, for instance) which may or may not approach the stake-holder criteria C. The issue here is to assess, in a parallel exercise, which is the assurrance that the Stake-holder whishes to see demonstrated, and to ensure that, by addressing those criteria, E meets C. The value claim is distant from the actual process, but may record rationally the way that something occurred. The construction of assurrance criteria is a design exercise, as is the construction of the artifact. It changes at least the world of the designer, by changing the task that the designer must complete. In particular, it's not simply a knowledge question, but much more akin to the design of a test strategy for software.},

	abstract = {Personalization and intelligent tutor are two key factors in the research on learning environment. Intelligent tutoring system (ITS), which can imitate the human teachers' actions to implement one-to-one personalized teaching to some extent, is an effective tool for training the ability of problem solving. This research firstly discusses the concepts and methods of designing problem solving oriented ITS, and then develops the current iTutor based on the extended model of ITS. At last, the research adopts a quasi-experimental design to investigate the effectiveness of iTutor in skills acquisition. The results indicate that students in iTutor group experience better learning effectiveness than those in the control group. iTutor is found to be effective in improving the learning effectiveness of students with low-level prior knowledge.},

Once the ontology is formalized, it will be used to design a virtual Affective Pedagogical Tutor (APT) based on an Event-Condition-Action rule system to provide affective feedback, aiming to provide a positive change in students' behavior and performance.},

	abstract = {The focus of computerised learning has shifted from content delivery towards personalised online learning with Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). Oscar Conversational ITS (CITS) is a sophisticated ITS that uses a natural language interface to enable learners to construct their own knowledge through discussion. Oscar CITS aims to mimic a human tutor by dynamically detecting and adapting to an individual's learning styles whilst directing the conversational tutorial. Oscar CITS is currently live and being successfully used to support learning by university students. The major contribution of this paper is the development of the novel Oscar CITS adaptation algorithm and its application to the Felder--Silverman learning styles model. The generic Oscar CITS adaptation algorithm uniquely combines the strength of an individual's learning style preference with the available adaptive tutoring material for each tutorial question to decide the best fitting adaptation. A case study is described, where Oscar CITS is implemented to deliver an adaptive SQL tutorial. Two experiments are reported which empirically test the Oscar CITS adaptation algorithm with students in a real teaching/learning environment. The results show that learners experiencing a conversational tutorial personalised to their learning styles performed significantly better during the tutorial than those with an unmatched tutorial.},

These systems require an appropriate representation of the knowledge to be learnt, the Domain Module. The authoring of the Domain Module is cost and labour intensive, but its development cost might be lightened by profiting from semi-automatic Domain Module authoring techniques and promoting knowledge reuse. DOM-Sortze is a system that uses Natural Language Processing techniques, heuristic reasoning, and ontologies for the semi-automatic construction of the Domain Module from electronic textbooks. In order to determine how it might help in the Domain Module authoring process, it has been tested with an electronic textbook, and the gathered knowledge has been compared against the Domain Module that instructional designers developed manually. This paper presents DOM-Sortze and describes the experiment carried out.},

	abstract = {Before technology is transferred to the market, it must be validated empirically by simulating future practical use of the technology. Technology prototypes are first investigated in simplified contexts, and these simulations are scaled up to conditions of practice step by step as more becomes known about the technology. This paper discusses empirical research methods for scaling up new requirements engineering (RE) technology. When scaling up to practice, researchers want to generalize from validation studies to future practice. An analysis of scaling up technology in drug research reveals two ways to generalize, namely inductive generalization using statistical inference from samples, and analogic generalization using similarity between cases. Both are supported by abductive inference using mechanistic explanations of phenomena observed in the simulations. Illustrations of these inferences both in drug research and empirical RE research are given. Next, four kinds of methods for empirical RE technology validation are given, namely expert opinion, single-case mechanism experiments, technical action research and statistical difference-making experiments. A series of examples from empirical RE will illustrate the use of these methods, and the role of inductive generalization, analogic generalization, and abductive inference in them. Finally, the four kinds of empirical validation methods are compared with lists of validation methods known from empirical software engineering. The lists are combined to give an overview of some of the methods, instruments and data analysis techniques that may be used in empirical RE. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {An important aspect of human interaction is our ability to store, retain, recall and organise information. Memory assists in building rapport and gaining trust. The growing field of artificial companions involving long term and casual/social relationships will require appropriate handling of memories of the user by an Intelligent Virtual Agent (IVA). This is a first study to determine what types of personal information (i.e.; domain/task and casual/social) users expected an IVA to discuss and remember and how users responded to various levels of IVA recall and forgetting of that information: complete recall; total loss of recall; partial recall and incorrect recall. Our experiment collected conversations and survey responses from participants who interacted with a virtual real estate agent according to one of two treatments over three experimental sessions. No significant differences were found in participants' responses between task-focused or casual/social content, however a larger sample size may produce different results and some participants were not comfortable with answering the social questions. Recall was found to increase the user's enjoyment of interacting with the agent and also to increase the believability of the character over multiple interactions. We found that characters who recall information incorrectly are highly frustrating, are seen as having unnatural memory and this decreases the believability of the character. However, characters that exhibit forgetting, either explicitly stating their forgetfulness or not mentioning it at all, are seen to have a more natural memory and can help to increase the believability of the character. The study also suggests that forgetting affects the level of trust the user feels for the character. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Studies have shown that animation and simulation using information and communication technology (ICT) can help students to visualize and hence enhance their understanding in learning abstract chemistry topics. As a result, an interactive multimedia module with the pedagogical agent (IMMPA) named the EC Lab (Electrochemistry Lab) was developed in order to assist students in the learning of Electrochemistry topics. A non-equivalent pretest--posttest control group design investigation was carried out in order to gauge the effect of the IMMPA EC Lab on students' understanding and motivation in the learning of Electrochemistry. Some 127 Form Four students from two secondary schools in one of the districts in Malaysia were involved in the study. Each school had one treatment group and one control group taught by the same Chemistry teacher. Instruments involved were a pre- and posttest, a pre- and post-motivation questionnaire, and the IMMPA EC Lab. Results showed a significant difference between the control groups and treatment groups in the understanding of concepts in the learning of Electrochemistry.},

	abstract = {Over the past decades, intelligent conversational agents have been repeatedly used as pedagogical tools for fostering students' motivation and engagement in individual learning settings. However, in recent years, the uses of conversational agents have also been explored in collaborative contexts under the scope of Academically Productive Talk (APT). The theory of APT, which has derived from the work of the classroom discourse community, suggests a number of facilitative talk moves that have proven to effectively promote productive classroom conversations. Following the APT perspective, we propose the design of a teacher-configurable conversational agent system, named MentorChat. This dialogue support system leverages concept mapping as a domain modeling tool that enables the implementation of well-targeted agent interventions, aiming to stimulate constructive peer interactions in collaborative learning settings. In this paper, we also present the results of an evaluation study, where 40 students collaborated in dyads in order to accomplish two different tasks in MentorChat. The preliminary findings are quite encouraging as for the ease of use and user acceptance of the proposed conversational agent system.},

	abstract = {Emotional illiteracy exists in current e-learning environment, which will decay learning enthusiasm and productivity, and now gets more attentions in recent researches. Inspired by affective computing and active listening strategy, in this paper, a research and application framework of recognizing emotion based on textual interaction is presented first. Second, an emotion category model for e-learners is defined. Third, many Chinese metaphors are abstracted from the corpus according to the sentence semantics and syntax. Fourth, as the strategy of active learning, topic detection is used to detect the first turn in dialogs and recognize the type of emotion in the turn, which is different from the traditional emotion recognition approaches that try to classify every turn into an emotion category. Fifth, compared with Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, LogitBoost, Bagging, MultiClass Classifier, RBFnetwork, J48 algorithms and their corresponding cost-sensitive approaches, Random Forest and its corresponding cost-sensitive approaches achieve better results in our initial experiment of classifying the e-learners' emotions. Finally, a case-based reasoning for emotion regulation instance recommendation is proposed to guide the listener to regulate the negative emotion of a speaker, in which a weighted sum method of Chinese sentence similarity computation is adopted. The experimental result shows that the ratio of effective cases is 68\%. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The development of a mathematical MVP model can provide empirical support for the elements included in the MVP theory and serve as a tool for designing effective digital learning environments. A regression analysis of motivational, volitional, and performance data of 62 graduate students that interacted with an online simulation revealed a significant model that explained approximately 70\% of the variation in student satisfaction through motivational and volitional processing variables suggested by the MVP theory. Students' interest and curiosity toward the learning environment had the highest positive predicting power on students' satisfaction, while the volition processing variable had the lowest predicting power. Implications for the digital learning environments design and directions for future research are discussed. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper relates to the collaborative scenario in EMOTE EU FP7 project and its main goal is to develop and present the dialogue dimensions for a robotic tutor in a collaborative learning scenario grounded in human studies. Overall, seven dialogue dimensions between the teacher and students interaction were identified from data collected over 10 sessions of a collaborative serious game. Preliminary results regarding the teachers perspective of the students interaction suggest that student collaboration led to learning during the game. Besides, students seem to have learned a number of concepts as they played the game. We also present the protocol that was followed for the purposes of future data collection in human-human and human-robot interaction in similar scenarios.},

	abstract = {Animated agents have been found to positively impact student learning and/or perceptions within computer-based learning environments. However, there is little research on the agent characteristics preferred by K-12 students. The main purpose of this study was to examine student preferences for individual pedagogical agents and their preferences for various agent characteristics. Student preferences for the following agent characteristics were assessed using survey methodology: agent gender, age, realism, clothing, personality, speech pace, and tutoring approach. A total of N = 565 students from elementary through high school watched a computer-based multimedia overview of engineering. Four engineering disciplines were introduced by four animated agents: a young female, young male, old female, and old male agent. Immediately after viewing the computer-based overview, students completed surveys assessing preferences for the four agents and for individual agent characteristics. Results indicated that all students preferred agents and specific external agent characteristics that are close to their own external characteristics and favored internal agent characteristics that they felt would promote understanding of the domain. These findings suggest that animated agents used in computer-based K-12 engineering outreach should be close to the student's external characteristics. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A study was conducted at the Hellenic Open University (HOU), using a questionnaire that was completed by 94 undergraduate and postgraduate students. More than 94 \% of the students felt the need to communicate with their instructor and fellow students, but less actually did. More than 50 \% of the students experienced both positive and negative emotions, while women were more prone to negative feelings. Negative emotions motivated students mainly to contact the tutor, while both negative and positive emotions motivated them to contact their fellow students. After communication, the majority of students felt positive emotions more intensely and negative ones less intensely, due to support and encouragement that they received from their tutor and fellow students. More than 80 \% of the participants considered social presence as an important element of communication during their course, related to positive emotions. Regardless of the level of the course, age and marital status, quality student--tutor and student-student communication in the Hellenic Open University has an important effect on students' emotional well being.}}

The first step was to investigate the subject of character design through relevant material and literature. From this investigation, a total of four character designs have been developed -two "good" and two "evil" -within two different game titles of different graphical styles: One that is more cartoony/stylized and one that is more realistic. Prior to the production a number of work processes -production pipelines -used by artists in the game and movie industry were investigated. From this, the pipeline for the study was compiled. To end the study a survey was conducted, in order to obtain outside feedback for the character designs regarding their style and what personality traits they were associated with. The results show that the majority of the participants perceived the characters in the way that was intended, while the perception of graphical style was a lot more varied.},

In this paper we present a computational model of tutorial feedback selection based on the context of the immediate situation for which the feedback is selected as well as on politeness considerations shown to be of importance to increasing pedagogical efficacy of computer assisted learning (Wang et al.; 2008). The model is based on empirical studies with human tutors and on extensive linguistic analysis of human tutorial dialogues collected with the specific aim to inform the implementation of a natural language tutorial dialogue interface. The evaluation of the model, involving the comparison of its output with the linguistic responses produced by a human tutor, demonstrates the model's plausibility and highlights future directions for improving natural language human-computer interactions for educational purposes. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper examines whether a supplementary, motivating agent in a print tutorial can enhance student motivation and learning in software training. The agent served the role of motivator, attending the students to issues of task relevance and self-efficacy. The agent was presented in the tutorial by means of images and written messages. An experiment compared the agent condition with a no-agent (control) condition. Participants were 49 students (mean age 11.3 years) from the upper grades of elementary school. Data on motivation and learning were gathered before, during and after training. The findings revealed that students in the agent condition did significantly better on skills measures during and after training (i.e., performance indicators, posttest, and retention test). In addition, marginally significant differences favoring these students were found for flow experience during training and for motivational gains on task relevance and self-efficacy after training. The design strategies of the motivating agent are considered relevant for the creation of Animated Pedagogical Agents. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The Writing Pal is an intelligent tutoring system that provides writing strategy training. A large part of its artificial intelligence resides in the natural language processing algorithms to assess essay quality and guide feedback to students. Because writing is often highly nuanced and subjective, the development of these algorithms must consider a broad array of linguistic, rhetorical, and contextual features. This study assesses the potential for computational indices to predict human ratings of essay quality. Past studies have demonstrated that linguistic indices related to lexical diversity, word frequency, and syntactic complexity are significant predictors of human judgments of essay quality but that indices of cohesion are not. The present study extends prior work by including a larger data sample and an expanded set of indices to assess new lexical, syntactic, cohesion, rhetorical, and reading ease indices. Three models were assessed. The model reported by McNamara, Crossley, and McCarthy (Written Communication 27:57-86, 2010) including three indices of lexical diversity, word frequency, and syntactic complexity accounted for only 6\% of the variance in the larger data set. A regression model including the full set of indices examined in prior studies of writing predicted 38\% of the variance in human scores of essay quality with 91\% adjacent accuracy (i.e., within 1 point). A regression model that also included new indices related to rhetoric and cohesion predicted 44\% of the variance with 94\% adjacent accuracy. The new indices increased accuracy but, more importantly, afford the means to provide more meaningful feedback in the context of a writing tutoring system.},

	abstract = {The goal of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) that interact in natural language is to emulate the benefits that a well-trained human tutor provides to students, by interpreting student answers and appropriately responding in order to encourage elaboration. BRCA Gist is an ITS developed using AutoTutor Lite, a Web-based version of AutoTutor. Fuzzy-trace theory theoretically motivated the development of BRCA Gist, which engages people in tutorial dialogues to teach them about genetic breast cancer risk. We describe an empirical method to create tutorial dialogues and fine-tune the calibration of BRCA Gist's semantic processing engine without a team of computer scientists. We created five interactive dialogues centered on pedagogic questions such as "What should someone do if she receives a positive result for genetic risk of breast cancer?" This method involved an iterative refinement process of repeated testing with different texts and successively making adjustments to the tutor's expectations and settings in order to improve performance. The goal of this method was to enable BRCA Gist to interpret and respond to answers in a manner that best facilitated learning. We developed a method to analyze the efficacy of the tutor's dialogues. We found that BRCA Gist's assessment of participants' answers was highly correlated with the quality of the answers found by trained human judges using a reliable rubric. The dialogue quality between users and BRCA Gist predicted performance on a breast cancer risk knowledge test completed after exposure to the tutor. The appropriateness of BRCA Gist's feedback also predicted the quality of answers and breast cancer risk knowledge test scores.},

	abstract = {Tutoring technologies for supporting learning from errors via negative feedback are highly developed and have proven their worth in empirical evaluations. However, observations of empirical tutoring dialogs highlight the importance of positive feedback in the practice of expert tutoring. We hypothesize that positive feedback works by reducing student uncertainty about tentative but correct problem solving steps. Positive feedback should communicate three pieces of explanatory information: (a) those features of the situation that made the action the correct one, both in general terms and with reference to the specifics of the problem state; (b) the description of the action at a conceptual level and (c) the important aspect of the change in the problem state brought about by the action. We describe how a positive feedback capability was implemented in a mature, constraint-based tutoring system, SQL-Tutor, which teaches by helping students learn from their errors. Empirical evaluation shows that students who were interacting with the augmented version of SQL-Tutor learned at twice the speed as the students who interacted with the standard, error feedback only, version. We compare our approach with some alternative techniques to provide positive feedback in intelligent tutoring systems.},

To provide empathic capabilities to a rational dialog agent, we propose a formal model of emotions based on an empirical and theoretical analysis of the users' conditions of emotion elicitation. The emotions are represented by particular mental states of the agent, composed of beliefs, uncertainties and intentions. This semantically grounded formal representation enables a rational dialog agent to identify from a dialogical situation the empathic emotion that it should express. An implementation and an evaluation of an empathic rational dialog agent have enabled us to validate the proposed model of empathy.},

	abstract = {College students had 30 min to study a 17-frame online lesson on distance learning that included navigational aids (for showing the learner's location in the lesson), signaling aids (for highlighting the important content), both aids, or no aids. On a 30-item usability survey consisting of 8 usability scales, students who received navigational aids produced significantly higher mean ratings on each of the 8 usability scales - ease of use, satisfaction of use, awareness of lesson structure, awareness of lesson length, awareness of location, ease of navigation, lesson comprehension, and lesson learning - with effect sizes ranging from d = 0.50 to d = 1.35. Students who received signaling aids produced significantly higher ratings on 4 of the 8 usability scales - ease of use, satisfaction of use, lesson comprehension, and lesson learning with effect sizes ranging from d = 0.39 to d = 2.15. Results help to clarify the mechanism underlying previous findings showing that students learned more from e-lessons that contained navigational aids. In the present study, there was a significant positive correlation between usability rating and recall test score for 5 of the 8 usability scales (particularly for ease of use), indicating partial support for the prediction that learners' satisfaction with an e-learning system is related to their learning outcome. Results support the predictions of the emotional design hypothesis and have implications for the design of e-learning interfaces. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This information enables the system to be fully adapted to the student. Our research work intends to propose a student model and enhance it with semantics by developing (or via) an ontology in order to be exploitable effectively within an ITS, for example as a domain-independent vocabulary for the communication between intelligent agents. The ontology schema consists of two main taxonomies: (a) student's academic information and (b) student's personal information. The characteristics of the student that have been included in the student model ontology were derived from an empirical study on a sample of students.},

Results showed that for teaching engineering in a computer-based instructional module, students preferred an animated engineering tutor that was similar to their age, matching their own gender, with a fun personality, and that speaks slowly. {\copyright} 2012 IEEE.},

The language action perspective provides methods for analyzing and modelling repeated business conversations including synchronous CMC. This paper describes a method for creating a profiles for large amounts of synchronous CMC conversation after it has occurred. Called a speech act profile, it is based on speech act theory. The profiles can be used either as patterns for classifying conversations or for creating visual maps of the conversations themselves. Application of the profiles in information retrieval and deception detection are discussed.}}

	abstract = {Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) have been growing in popularity with educational researchers, instructors, and learners in online environments. Online discussions are as important in MOOCs as in other online courses. Online discussions that occur in MOOCs are influenced by additional factors resulting from their volatile and voluntary participation structure. This article aims to examine discussions that took place in MobiMOOC in the spring of 2011, a MOOC structured around mobile learning. This line of inquiry focused on language from the discussions that contained emotive vocabulary in the MobiMOOC discussion forums. Emotive vocabulary is words or phrases that are implicitly emotional (happy, sad, frustrated) or relate to emotional contexts (I wasn't able to...). This emotive vocabulary, when present, was examined to determine whether it could serve as a mechanism for predicting future and continued participation in the MOOC. In this research, narrative inquiry approach was used in order to shine a light on the possible predictive qualities of emotive text in both participants who withdrew from the course as well as moderately or moderately active participants. The results indicated that emotive vocabulary usage did not significantly predict or impact participation retention in MobiMOOC. (Contains 5 figures and 4 endnotes.)},

However, recent studies indicate that students had lesser interest to learn the subject. In response to this phenomenon, this study was carried out to identify the factors that affect students' interest in learning Islamic education in schools in Malaysia. Data were gathered through in-depth semi-structured interviews with six Form Four students from a selected secondary school in the state of Selangor in central Malaysia. The findings indicate that there are two major factors affecting students' interest in learning Islamic education which are situational factors and individual factors. The situational factors are: (1) the parents' influence, (2) the Islamic education teacher's influence and, (3) the Islamic education curriculum, whereas the individual factors are: (1) initial interest that resides within each individual and, (2) learner diversity in learning. The findings also revealed that the Islamic education teacher is the key factor in affecting students' interest towards the subject.}}

	abstract = {We developed an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) that aims to promote engagement and learning by dynamically detecting and responding to students' boredom and disengagement. The tutor uses a commercial eye tracker to monitor a student's gaze patterns and identify when the student is bored, disengaged, or is zoning out. The tutor then attempts to reengage the student with dialog moves that direct the student to reorient his or her attentional patterns towards the animated pedagogical agent embodying the tutor. We evaluated the efficacy of the gaze-reactive tutor in promoting learning, motivation, and engagement in a controlled experiment where 48 students were tutored on four biology topics with both gaze-reactive and non-gaze-reactive (control condition) versions of the tutor. The results indicated that: (a) gaze-sensitive dialogs were successful in dynamically reorienting students' attentional patterns to the important areas of the interface, (b) gaze-reactivity was effective in promoting learning gains for questions that required deep reasoning, (c) gaze-reactivity had minimal impact on students' state motivation and on self-reported engagement, and (d) individual differences in scholastic aptitude moderated the impact of gaze-reactivity on overall learning gains. We discuss the implications of our findings, limitations, future work, and consider the possibility of using gaze-reactive ITSs in classrooms.},

	abstract = {Conversational agents are attributed humanlike characteristics; in particular, they are often assumed to have a gender. There is evidence that gender sets up expectations that have an impact on user experiences with agents. The objective of this paper is to explore gender affordances of conversational agents. Our examination takes a holistic approach to the analysis of the application of gender stereotypes to nine chatterbots: six embodied (three male and three female), two disembodied (male and female), and a robot embodiment. Building on social psychology research, we test the persistence of gender stereotypes in the selection of conversation topics and in the elicitation of disinhibition and verbal abuse. Our study is based on quantitative textual analysis of interaction logs. A dictionary of English sexual slang and derogatory terms was developed for this study. Results show that gender stereotypes tend to affect interaction more at the relational (style) level then at the referential (content) level of conversation. People attribute negative stereotypes to female-presenting chatterbots more often than they do to male-presenting chatterbots, and female-presenting chatterbots are more often the objects of implicit and explicit sexual attention and swear words. We conclude by calling for a more informed analysis of user interactions that considers the full range of user interactions. ?? 2012 British Informatics Society Limited. All rights reserved.},

In Experiment 1, a full dialogue condition and a read-only control condition were compared with a mixed dialogue condition in which students engaged in full dialogue for half the problems followed by problems requiring only a limited engagement. We found that the mixed dialogue condition produced results as impressive as the full dialogue condition and took less time. Experiment 2 replicated these findings and further examined issues of time engaged in learning, quality of instruction, and learning gains. Overall, these results show that dialogue-based intelligent tutoring systems could be designed in a more efficient manner to maximize learning and minimize the cost of time-on-task. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This fact contributes to the creation of social environments for interaction, what combined in Web 2.0 applications, makes up appropriate instruments to explore new methodological approaches and encourage existing ones. All of this explains why collaborative learning methods through ICT is rapidly gaining importance and scope in educational innovation.

After completing a learning session with the tutor, student emotions were judged by the students themselves (self-judgments), untrained peers, and trained judges. Transcripts from the tutorial dialogues were analyzed with four methods that included 1) identifying direct expressions of affect, 2) aligning the semantic content of student responses to affective terms, 3) identifying psychological and linguistic terms that are predictive of affect, and 4) assessing cohesion relationships that might reveal student affect. Models constructed by regressing the proportional occurrence of each emotion on textual features derived from these methods yielded large effects (R2 = 38\%) for the psychological, linguistic, and cohesion-based methods, but not the direct expression and semantic alignment methods. We discuss the theoretical, methodological, and applied implications of our findings toward text-based emotion detection during tutoring.},

With the aim of keeping students' attention through a game, in this paper we show the implementation of game-based learning systems with a pedagogical agent. We presents two models for assessing student's knowledge used by a pedagogical agent which is a part of the new class of Multimedia Interactive Modules for Learning - MIMLE. One of the models is used for activating the agent. It is realized as a window of Help option and built in accordance to Marcov decision process theory (MDP). The basic goal of this mode is to determine the minimal intervention of the agent towards making the right direction concerning the studying process based on simulation learning. With the second, long-term model, we have assessed student's knowledge in the current game level that is used to decide students should pass on to the next level of learning or if they should stay on the same level. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Motivation is the driver of guidance, control and persistence in human behavior. What strengthens a person's behavior? What guides such behaviors or conducts then in a certain direction? What enhanced or maintained the behavior? It is called motivation. On the importance of motivation, researches have shown that employees with high job motivation show, greater commitment to their job; on the other hand Workers who feel more commitment even when things are not moving forward according to the procedure , minimize the impact of this problem. {\copyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The system facilitates different kinds of learning initiated by the human tutor or by the system itself. We demonstrate these principles in the case of learning about object colours and basic shapes.},

	abstract = {Web-based education is particularly appropriate for remote teaching and learning at any time and place, away from classrooms and does not necessarily require the presence of a human instructor. The need for time and place independence is even greater in some cases, such as for medical instructors who are usually doctors that have to treat patients on top of their tutoring duties. However, this independence from real teachers and classrooms may influence negatively the students who may feel deprived of the benefits of human-human interaction. In this paper we describe a novel approach for incorporating affective characteristics into e-learning through an authoring tool. The authoring tool incorporates and adapts principles of a cognitive theory for modeling possible emotional states that a tutoring agent may use for educational purposes. Medical instructors may use this authoring tool to create their own educational characters that will interact affectively with their students in the e-learning environment. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The adaptive system varies its content based on the automatic uncertainty and correctness labels for each turn. Our controlled experimental evaluation shows that the adaptive system yields higher global performance than two non-adaptive control systems, but the difference is only significant for a subset of students. Our system error analysis indicates that noisy affect labeling is a major performance bottleneck, yielding fewer than expected adaptations thus lower than expected performance. However, the percentage of received adaptation correlates with higher performance over all students. Moreover, when uncertainty is accurately recognized and adapted to, local performance is significantly improved.},

	abstract = {We describe the design and evaluation of two different dynamic student uncertainty adaptations in wizarded versions of a spoken dialogue tutoring system. The two adaptive systems adapt to each student turn based on its uncertainty, after an unseen human \enquote{wizard} performs speech recognition and natural language understanding and annotates the turn for uncertainty. The design of our two uncertainty adaptations is based on a hypothesis in the literature that uncertainty is an \enquote{opportunity to learn}; both adaptations use additional substantive content to respond to uncertain turns, but the two adaptations vary in the complexity of these responses. The evaluation of our two uncertainty adaptations represents one of the first controlled experiments to investigate whether substantive dynamic responses to student affect can significantly improve performance in computer tutors. To our knowledge we are the first study to show that dynamically responding to uncertainty can significantly improve learning during computer tutoring. We also highlight our ongoing evaluation of our uncertainty-adaptive systems with respect to other important performance metrics, and we discuss how our corpus can be used by the wider computer speech and language community as a linguistic resource supporting further research on effective affect-adaptive spoken dialogue systems in general.},

One hundred and thirty female students were selected according to simple random sampling. Their FLL and CALL attitudes were assessed by A-FLL and A-CALL questionnaires. The findings revealed that Iranian students showed general positive attitudes towards CALL and FLL. CALL attitudes and computer use were found to be positively related. However, attitudes towards CALL were not related to age, computer ownership, and access. Furthermore, a positive correlation between attitudes towards CALL and FLL attitude was found, suggesting that higher FLL attitudes could predict positive attitudes towards CALL. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

We highlight several evidence-based approaches that may be useful in the next generation of distance and online learning. These include principles and applications stemming from the theories of self-regulation and multimedia learning, research-based motivational principles and collaborative learning principles. We also discuss the pedagogical challenges inherent in distance and online learning that need to be considered in instructional design and software development.},

	abstract = {The majority of Intelligent Tutoring System architectures are focused on supporting learners through content retrieval or in one or more given subject matters; examples of this can be found in Baghera [1], MyClass, Andes [2], Gramy, Advanced Geometry Tutor [7]. The implementation of such architectures are time-consuming and are generally not interoperable with other domains [3]. The presented research describes the experimentation of a Open Source, LMS enhanced with elements of AI aiming at supporting online teachers' and tutors' work by using a KB specific to relational and pedagogical aspects, not connected to a specific subject matter. Such implementation needs to be provided of an authoring tool easily and readily usable by tutors and teachers of different subjects and with medium level IT training. Starting point of our investigation has been a preliminary analysis of machine-mediated, human-human interactions (MM-HHI) and communications by using the Teachers' thinking approach [4] [5] [6]. We considered messages exchanged between teachers/tutors and online students in three post-graduate, online courses running at the University of Macerata during 2008 - 2010 by the Faculty of Education. The study showed that about 30\% of messages concerned structured information that could be straightforwardly retrieved by an artificial agent; almost all remaining messages were instead deeply bound to student's learning path or required a significant input by the teacher/tutor, while the residual part of messages could - to some extents - be delegated to an intelligent agent having access to students' tracking data in order to display visual information to users or trigger alarms to tutors. The investigation carried out prompted us for the deployment of an Open Source chat-bot system that would retrieve information already coded into the courses or originated by students through the analysis of their activity logs; the chat-bot agent uses this structured information in order to answer students' most common questions hence relieving teachers and tutors from doing this repetitive task. The system is being implemented on a OLAT ver. 6.3 LMS loosely coupled to a JADE-based Multi Agent System in charge of processing user tracking data and running the ALICE chat-bot integrated with the platform messaging system. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The mental state is built on the basis of the emotional state of the user and their intention, and is recognized by means of a module conceived as an intermediate phase between natural language understanding and the dialogue management in the architecture of the systems. We have implemented the method in the UAH system, for which the evaluation results with both simulated and real users show that taking into account the user's mental state improves system performance as well as its perceived quality.},

The purpose of learner models is to drive personalization based on learner and learning characteristics that are considered as important for the learning process, such as cognitive, affective and behavioral variables. Despite the huge amount of theoretical propositions of learner characteristics considered as relevant for learner models, practical payoffs are rather sparse. This study aims to overview the empirical research on the mere value of learner models in the development of adaptive learning environments. The results show that a lot of high-quality studies are situated in a rather shattered research field, building few bridges from theory to practice. We conclude with the call for a theory or framework integrating current and past research results that is able to guide theory-based and systematic empirical research having concrete hypotheses on the merits of learner characteristics in adaptive learning environments. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The health care sector is an area of social and economic interest in several countries; therefore, there have been lots of efforts in the use of electronic health records. Nevertheless, there is evidence suggesting that these systems have not been adopted as it was expected, and although there are some proposals to support their adoption, the proposed support is not by means of information and communication technology which can provide automatic tools of support. The aim of this study is to identify the critical adoption factors for electronic health records by physicians and to use them as a guide to support their adoption process automatically.

METHODS: This paper presents, based on the PRISMA statement, a systematic literature review in electronic databases with adoption studies of electronic health records published in English. Software applications that manage and process the data in the electronic health record have been considered, i.e.: computerized physician prescription, electronic medical records, and electronic capture of clinical data. Our review was conducted with the purpose of obtaining a taxonomy of the physicians main barriers for adopting electronic health records, that can be addressed by means of information and communication technology; in particular with the information technology roles of the knowledge management processes. Which take us to the question that we want to address in this work: "What are the critical adoption factors of electronic health records that can be supported by information and communication technology?". Reports from eight databases covering electronic health records adoption studies in the medical domain, in particular those focused on physicians, were analyzed.

RESULTS: The review identifies two main issues: 1) a knowledge-based classification of critical factors for adopting electronic health records by physicians; and 2) the definition of a base for the design of a conceptual framework for supporting the design of knowledge-based systems, to assist the adoption process of electronic health records in an automatic fashion. From our review, six critical adoption factors have been identified: user attitude towards information systems, workflow impact, interoperability, technical support, communication among users, and expert support. The main limitation of the taxonomy is the different impact of the adoption factors of electronic health records reported by some studies depending on the type of practice, setting, or attention level; however, these features are a determinant aspect with regard to the adoption rate for the latter rather than the presence of a specific critical adoption factor.

CONCLUSIONS: The critical adoption factors established here provide a sound theoretical basis for research to understand, support, and facilitate the adoption of electronic health records to physicians in benefit of patients.},

Pedagogical agents have been used that provide emo- tional or motivational feedback. Students using such agents increased their math value, self-concept and mastery orientation, with females reporting more confi- dence and less frustration. Low-achieving students---one third of whom have learning disabilities---report higher affective needs than their higher-achieving peers. After interacting with affective pedagogical agents, low-achieving students improved their affective outcomes and reported reduced frustration and anxiety.},

	abstract = {General frameworks of mind map across tasks and domains. By what means can a general architecture know when it has adapted to a specific task, a particular environment or a specific state of a previously known environment? Our current work on this theme presents an affect- and affordance-based core for mind. This draws on evidence from neuroscience, philosophy and psychology. However, we differentiate between the mechanisms and processes thought to be allied to cognition and intelligent behaviour in biological architectures and the foundational requirements necessary for similarly intelligent behaviour or cognitive-like processes to exist in synthetic architectures. Work on emotion is a morass of definitions and competing theories. We suggest that we should not further this confused framework with unnecessary (and often unneeded) models of emotion for artificial systems. Rather, we should look to foundational requirements for intelligent systems and ask do we require emotions in machines or an alternative equivalent, for example affect, of use in control and self-regulation? This paper addresses this issue with experimentation in a number of simulated and robotic test-beds. {\copyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Nevertheless, only few of the existing adaptive systems have been evaluated. One of the most important reasons for this lack is, that measures for adaptivity success have not been investigated systematically up to now. The aim of this PhD thesis is to explore a methodology for the empirical evaluation of adaptive systems, including validated criteria, experimen- tal designs and procedures. It will be demonstrated that cognitive and behavioral factors provide important evidence for adaptivity success},

Further, to resolve resulting conflicts, we present encompassing interaction strategies that attempt to balance the competing requirements along with dialogues from our working prototype to illustrate these interaction strategies in operation.

Results showed that facial expressions and head movements have great impact on student's impressions and engagement with the virtual pedagogical agent. Experimental results suggest that virtual pedagogical agent that produce natural head movements and appropriate facial expressions while narrating a story produce much more positive user experiences than virtual pedagogical agent that lack these behaviors.},

The multimodal affect detector uses feature-level fusion to combine the sensory channels and linear discriminant analyses to discriminate between naturally occurring experiences of boredom, engagement/flow, confusion, frustration, delight, and neutral. Training and validation data for the affect detector were collected in a study where 28 learners completed a 32-min. tutorial session with AutoTutor, an intelligent tutoring system with conversational dialogue. Classification results supported a channel judgment type interaction, where the face was the most diagnostic channel for spontaneous affect judgments (i.e., at any time in the tutorial session), while conversational cues were superior for fixed judgments (i.e., every 20 s in the session). The analyses also indicated that the accuracy of the multichannel model (face, dialogue, and posture) was statistically higher than the best single-channel model for the fixed but not spontaneous affect expressions. However, multichannel models reduced the discrepancy (i.e., variance in the precision of the different emotions) of the discriminant models for both judgment types. The results also indicated that the combination of channels yielded superadditive effects for some affective states, but additive, redundant, and inhibitory effects for others. We explore the structure of the multimodal linear discriminant models and discuss the implications of some of our major findings.},

	abstract = {Intelligent tutoring systems are computer learning systems which personalise their learning content for an individual, based on learner characteristics such as existing knowledge. A recent extension to ITS is to capture student learning styles using a questionnaire and adapt subject content accordingly, however students do not always take the time to complete questionnaires carefully. This paper describes Oscar, a conversational intelligent tutoring system (CITS) which utilises a conversational agent to conduct the tutoring. The CITS aims to mimic a human tutor by dynamically estimating and adapting to a student's learning style during a tutoring conversation. Oscar also offers intelligent solution analysis and problem support for learners. By implicitly modelling the student's learning style during tutoring, Oscar can personalise tutoring to each individual learner to improve the effectiveness of the tutoring. The paper presents the novel methodology and architecture for constructing a CITS. An initial pilot study has been conducted in the domain of tutoring of undergraduate Science and Engineering students using the Index of Learning Styles ILS) model. The experiments to investigate the estimation of learning style have produced encouraging results in the estimation of learning style through a tutoring conversation.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have evaluated the effects of pedagogical agents on students' learning outcomes, but so far, beneficial effects have not been consistently demonstrated. The ambiguous results might partly be due to the strong emphasis on cognitive outcomes, which is characteristic for research in teaching and learning. The paper suggests a shift of attention to socio-emotional and relational variables, which might be considered as relevant moderator variables in learning or even as learning outcomes per se, for example, in social learning. In order to achieve this goal, we suggest a systematic account of the results from social psychology and in particular from nonverbal communication research, and findings from studies on the social effects of embodied agents in general. This perspective will include (1) a distinction between static and dynamic aspects of embodiment, such as the visual appearance of agents and their nonverbal behavior, and (2) a more systematic approach concerning the functions of embodiment and nonverbal behavior, such as modeling, discourse and dialogue functions, and socio-emotional effects. A further argument addresses the necessity of complementing outcome measures by process measures, which are sensitive to the tasks and the changing situational demands that occur during learning processes and tutor-learner interaction.

To accomplish this, it is necessary to understand the composition of this construct and how to evaluate it. Building on previous work that posited a theory of engagement and identified a core set of attributes that operationalized this construct, we constructed and evaluated a multidimensional scale to measure user engagement. In this paper we describe the development of the scale, as well as two large-scale studies (N=440 and N=802) that were undertaken to assess its reliability and validity in online shopping environments. In the first we used Reliability Analysis and Exploratory Factor Analysis to identify six attributes of engagement: Perceived Usability, Aesthetics, Focused Attention, Felt Involvement, Novelty, and Endurability. In the second we tested the validity of and relationships among those attributes using Structural Equation Modeling. The result of this research is a multidimensional scale that may be used to test the engagement of software applications. In addition, findings indicate that attributes of engagement are highly intertwined, a complex interplay of user-system interaction variables. Notably, Perceived Usability played a mediating role in the relationship between Endurability and Novelty, Aesthetics, Felt Involvement, and Focused Attention.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses modeling user behavior in interactions between two people who do not share a common spoken language and communicate with the aid of an automated bidirectional speech translation system. These interaction settings are complex. The translation machine attempts to bridge the language gap by mediating the verbal communication, noting however that the technology may not be always perfect. In a step toward understanding user behavior in this mediated communication scenario, usability data from doctor-patient dialogs involving a two way English-Persian speech translation system are analyzed. We specifically consider user behavior in light of potential uncertainty in the communication between the interlocutors. We analyze the Retry (Repeat and Rephrase) versus Accept behaviors in the mediated verbal channel and as a result identify three user types - Accommodating, Normal and Picky, and propose a dynamic Bayesian network model of user behavior. To validate the model, we performed offline and online experiments. The experimental results using offline data show that correct user type is clearly identified as a user keeps his/her consistent behavior in a given interaction condition. In the online experiment, agent feedback was presented to users according to the user types. We show high user satisfaction and interaction efficiency in the analysis of user interview, video data, questionnaire and log data. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Social interaction among people is an essential part of every society, and a strong foundation for the development and self-actualization of a person. Even in virtual environments we tend to interact in a social way. Our research addresses the tasks of recognition, interpretation, and visualization of affect communicated through text messaging. In order to facilitate sensitive and expressive interaction in computer-mediated communication, we previously introduced a novel syntactical rule-based approach to affect recognition from text. The evaluation of the developed Affect Analysis Model showed promising results regarding its capability to accurately recognize affective information in text from an existing corpus of informal online conversations. To enrich the user's experience in online communication, to make it enjoyable, exciting, and fun, we implemented a web-based Instant Messaging (IM) application, AffectIM, and endowed it with emotional intelligence by integrating the developed Affect Analysis Model. This paper describes the findings of a twenty-person study conducted with our AffectIM system. The results of the study indicate that our IM system with automatic emotion recognition function can achieve a level of affective intelligence (system is successful at conveying the user's feelings, avatar expression is appropriate) that is comparable to "gold standard", where users select the label of the conveyed emotion manually. {\copyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Nowadays, with the fast popularization and development of the WWW, more and more people are interested in e-learning via web. There are many e-learning systems now; these systems provide some simple tools to manage and search a lot of teaching materials. However, the traditional teaching materials base neglects to integrate semantic and concept teaching knowledge, it is impossible for all participants to effectively search and share valuable teaching knowledge to satisfy the teaching and learning demands in e-learning. Ontology technology and knowledge management (KM) are the popular technology, they play more and more important roles in development of information system. So this paper integrates ontology technology and knowledge management into e-learning system so that users can easily and conveniently organize, share and reuse knowledge during e-learning. This paper performs the following tasks: (1) introduction e-learning system, ontology technology and knowledge management; (2) presentation of an architecture for e-learning system integrated ontology technology and knowledge management (EL-OKM); (3) discussion of knowledge ontology construction; (4) implementation of a simple prototype system; (5) conclusion and expectation of the further work.},

Therefore, it may be inserted into any intelligent learning environment that is also capable to communicate using FIPA-ACL. Persistence of information is ensured by XML files, increasing the agent's portability. The agent also includes a mechanism for automatically updating new behaviors and characters once available in the server. A simulation environment was conceived to test the proposed agent.},

The interaction effect between type of instruction and agent nonverbal behavior (deictic gestures and facial expression) was also investigated. A total of 236 college students learned from an animated pedagogical agent that varied by two factors: deictic gestures and facial expression within one of two instructional environments: one training them to perform tasks within a software program (procedural learning outcome); the other focusing on changing their beliefs regarding intellectual property (attitudinal learning outcome). Results indicated that the main effects of agent facial expression and gesture as well as the interaction were significant for agent perception and learning. With regard to learning, for attitudinal instruction, participants learned more when the agent's facial expression was present but deictic gesture was absent; however, for procedural instruction, students learned more when the agent's gestures were present. These results are discussed in light of a preliminary pedagogical agent design principle that suggests that it is most desirable to employ the one nonverbal communicative behavior that is most appropriate to the learning outcome. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The method extends the current practice by focusing not only on cognitive but also affective considerations that may influence e-learning usability. The method was developed according to an established methodology in HCI research and relied upon a conceptual framework that combines Web and instructional design parameters and associates them with the most prominent affective learning dimension, which is intrinsic motivation to learn. The latter is proposed as a new usability measure that is considered more appropriate to evaluate e-learning designs. Two large empirical studies were conducted in order to evaluate usability of e-learning courses offered in corporate environments. The results provide valuable evidence for reliability and validity of the method, thus providing evidence that usability practitioners can use it with confidence when evaluating the design of e-learning applications.},

Embodied pedagogical agents have been regarded as practical and powerful tools for instructions in these researches. However, it is hard to find a development kits that support the instructor or teacher to create interactive learning applications together with animated pedagogical agents. Therefore, in order to facilitate the instructor or teacher to generate the content materials of digital learning, we proposed an IDML-based embodied pedagogical agent system(IDML-based EPAS). The system provides the opportunity for teachers to integrate their teaching contents into multimedia presentations and to create embodied pedagogical agents for attracting learners' attention. Moreover, learners can interact with digital learning materials for facilitating the knowledge acquirement. Finally, we utilized the instruction of traffic safety as the interactive learning materials in the IDML-based EPAS for assisting learners to gain more positive attitudes and better achievement.},

To create ontology (semi-) automatically has been a challenging and critical problem to make Semantic Web come true. Many methods have been reported on ontology learning from the Web by analyzing the page contents. However, they are not applicable for learning ontology from organization Websites, where the description of a concept or an individual is distributed across multiple Web pages, and the ontological information can only be discovered by considering Website structure. We propose a Website structure based method to extract organizational ontology from organization Websites. Multiple organizational ontology of the same domain can be merged into domain ontology. This method employs both the intra-page and inter-page hierarchical relations hidden in Website structure for ontology learning. The empirical experiments show the effectiveness of this approach.},

Example-based dialog modeling (EBDM) is a simple and effective method for prototyping and deploying of various dialog systems. This paper also introduces the system architecture of multi-domain dialog systems using the EBDM framework and the domain spotting technique. In our experiments, we evaluate our system using both simulated and real users.

Aims: This study assesses the impact of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which are the recommended EBSE method for aggregating evidence. Method: We used the standard systematic literature review method employing a manual search of 10 journals and 4 conference proceedings. Results: Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4. Conclusions: Currently, the topic areas covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews. The series of cost estimation SLRs demonstrate the potential value of EBSE for synthesising evidence and making it available to practitioners. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are essential to summarise evidence relating to efficacy and safety of healthcare interventions accurately and reliably. The clarity and transparency of these reports, however, are not optimal. Poor reporting of systematic reviews diminishes their value to clinicians, policy makers, and other users. Since the development of the QUOROM (quality of reporting of meta-analysis) statement-a reporting guideline published in 1999-there have been several conceptual, methodological, and practical advances regarding the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported. Realising these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evaluations of health care interventions. The PRISMA statement consists of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram. The checklist includes items deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review. In this explanation and elaboration document, we explain the meaning and rationale for each checklist item. For each item, we include an example of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature. The PRISMA statement, this document, and the associated website (www.prisma-statement.org/) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.},

In 2 meetings each week throughout an 8-week Portuguese course for beginners, the first author described her language learning experiences to the second author. Sessions were transcribed and then coded and analyzed. A theoretical model grounded in the learners expe- riences was developed to understand the learners affective responses to the language learning process, the events from which her affect sprang, and her affective trajectory over the 8 weeks. This study is a response to the need for methodological and epistemological diversity in second language acquisition research and contributes to studies that focus on the affective responses of the learner to the language learning experience. Implications for the role played by emo- tion in learners classroom foreign language learning and the development of sociocultural competence in a second language are discussed."},

	abstract = {Purpose -- The purpose of this paper is to interpret aspects of education for sustainability in relation to educational theories of the affective domain (values, attitudes and behaviours) and suggest how the use of these theories, and relevant experience, in other educational areas could benefit education for sustainability. Design/methodology/approach -- An analysis based on a literature review of relevant educational endeavours in affective learning. Findings -- This paper suggests that most teaching and assessment in higher education focus on cogitative skills of knowledge and understanding rather than on affective outcomes of values, attitudes and behaviours. Some areas of higher education, however, have effectively pursued affective outcomes and these use particular learning and teaching activities to do so. Key issues for consideration include assessing outcomes and evaluating courses, providing academic credit for affective outcomes, key roles for role models and designing realistic and acceptable learning outcomes in the affective domain. Practical implications -- Educators for sustainability could use this relevant theoretical underpinning and experience gained in other areas of education to address the impact of their own learner-support activities. Originality/value -- Educators have traditionally been reluctant to pursue affective learning outcomes but often programmes of study simply fail to identify and describe their legitimate aims in these terms. This paper emphasises the application of a relevant theoretical underpinning to support educators' legitimate aspirations for affective learning outcomes. It will also help these educators to reflect on how the use of these approaches accords with the liberal traditions of higher education},

Therefore, the paper proposes a research problem-based learning (RPBL) model as the system structure in order to lead students through a systematic pedagogical process, but at the same time makes adaptive learning possibilities available through the customizable task list. The preliminary formative evaluation suggests minor modification of the system and provides positive feedbacks to its instructional use and development.},

Thus, some kind of adaptation or tailoring is always necessary. The goal of software process tailoring is to adapt an "off-the-shelf" software process to meet the needs of a specific organization or project. Although process tailoring is a mandatory activity in most software process proposals, it is usually carried out by following an ad-hoc approach, and the amount of research done on this topic to date can be considered small. This paper presents a systematic review of software process tailoring, analyzing the existing approaches towards this activity, discussing the main issues related to the problem, and providing an up-to-date and complete framework in which to position new research activities.},

In this paper, we study the problem of autocompletion not just at the level of a single \enquote{word}, but at the level of a multi-word \enquote{phrase}. There are two main challenges: one is that the number of phrases (both the number possible and the number actually observed in a corpus) is combina- torially larger than the number of words; the second is that a \enquote{phrase}, unlike a \enquote{word}, does not have a well-defined boundary, so that the autocompletion system has to decide not just what to predict, but also how far. We introduce a FussyTree structure to address the first challenge and the concept of a significant phrase to address the second. We develop a probabilistically driven multi- ple completion choice model, and exploit features such as frequency distributions to improve the quality of our suffix completions. We experimentally demonstrate the practica- bility and value of our technique for an email composition application and show that we can save approximately a fifth of the keystrokes typed.},

To the traditional scenario where students interact primarily with a single coach or tutor character on-screen, we introduce the addition of both a social, animate colearner, and the students own avatar character. Variations of the colearners attributes, informed by research literature on human partners, are explored through an online testbed application of English language idioms. Results from an experimental study with 76 Japanese college students reveal that cooperative colearners have a positive impact on students performance and experience, as well as increasing perceptions of the characters intelligence and credibility. Findings provide grounding for a fruitful new direction for pedagogical characters, where students learn alongside emotional companions.},

	abstract = {In social context, emotions play a prominent role in verbal and non-verbal communication. With their multi-modal perception, the aptitude of an interlocutor in identifying them, through a diversity of behaviors such as face movements, gestures, speech, is a fundamental aspect as judgment and decision making are influenced by mood, feelings, which facilitates human adaptation and social integration. In a cognitive activity such as learning, communication (between learners and tutors) is one of the fundamental issues, and its quality may influence the learning. Therefore, learning process implies cognitive aspects as well as socio-emotional aspects: in real world, teaching also implies to observe the student's affective behavior in order to detect affective responses which can express interest, excitation, confusion, etc. and suggest a review of the actual interaction flow. This paper presents an intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) architecture equipped with emotional management capabilities which make it possible the capture of student emotions during learning and affective response to learners' actions. The result system called AITS (affective tutoring system) could efficiently adapt content planning, learning/tutoring strategies and even tutoring dialogues based on affective and cognitive data},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research was to build an intelligent tutoring system capable of carrying on a natural language dialogue with a student who is solving a problem in physiology. Previous experiments have shown that students need practice in qualitative causal reasoning to internalize new knowledge and to apply it effectively and that they learn by putting their ideas into words.

METHODS: Analysis of a corpus of 75 hour-long tutoring sessions carried on in keyboard-to-keyboard style by two professors of physiology at Rush Medical College tutoring first-year medical students provided the rules used in tutoring strategies and tactics, parsing, and text generation. The system presents the student with a perturbation to the blood pressure, asks for qualitative predictions of the changes produced in seven important cardiovascular variables, and then launches a dialogue to correct any errors and to probe for possible misconceptions. The natural language understanding component uses a cascade of finite-state machines. The generation is based on lexical functional grammar.

RESULTS: Results of experiments with pretests and posttests have shown that using the system for an hour produces significant learning gains and also that even this brief use improves the student's ability to solve problems more then reading textual material on the topic. Student surveys tell us that students like the system and feel that they learn from it. The system is now in regular use in the first-year physiology course at Rush Medical College.

CONCLUSION: We conclude that the CIRCSIM-Tutor system demonstrates that intelligent tutoring systems can implement effective natural language dialogue with current language technology.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the manual and automatic labelling, from spontaneous speech, of a particular type of user affect that we call the cognitive state in a tutorial dialogue system with students of primary and early middle school ages. Our definition of the cognitive state is based on analysis of children's spontaneous speech, which is acquired during Wizard-of-Oz simulations of an intelligent math and physics tutor. The cognitive states of children are categorized into three classes: confidence, puzzlement, and hesitation. The manual labelling of cognitive states had an inter-transcriber agreement of kappa score 0.93. The automatic cognitive state labels are generated by classifying prosodic features, text features, and spectral features. Text features are generated from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system; features include indicator functions of keyword classes and part-of-speech sequences. Spectral features are created based on acoustic likelihood scores of a cognitive state-dependent ASR system, in which phoneme models are adapted to utterances labelled for a particular cognitive state. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been tested on both manually and automatically transcribed speech, and the test yielded very high correctness: 96.6\% for manually transcribed speech and 95.7\% for automatically recognized speech. Our study shows that the proposed spectral features greatly outperformed the other types of features in the cognitive state classification experiments. Our study also shows that the spectral and prosodic features derived directly from speech signals were very robust to speech recognition errors, much more than the lexical and part-of-speech based features.},

	abstract = {In designing and building tutorial dialogue systems it is important not only to understand the tactics employed by human tutors but also to understand how tutors decide when to use various tactics. We argue that these decisions are based not only on student problem-solving steps and the content of student utterances, but also on the meta-communicative information conveyed through spoken utterances (e.g., pauses, disfluencies, intonation). Since this information is often infrequent or unavailable in typed input, tutorial dialogue systems with speech interfaces have the potential to be more effective than those without. This paper gives an overview of the Spoken Conversational Tutor (SCoT) that we have built and describes how we are beginning to make use of spoken language information in SCoT. Specifically, we describe a study aimed at using meta-communicative information to gauge student uncertainty and respond accordingly. In this study, we identify linguistic devices used by human tutors when responding to utterances containing signals of uncertainty, integrate these response strategies into two versions of SCoT, and evaluate their relative effectiveness. Our main hypothesis - that tutors are more effective if they use these linguistic devices in response to student uncertainty - was not confirmed, but our secondary hypothesis - that tutors using these linguistic devices are more effective than tutors that do not use them - was supported by the results.}}

In this paper, we introduce OntoQA, an approach that analyzes ontology schemas and their populations (i.e. knowledgebases) and describes them through a well defined set of metrics. These metrics can highlight key characteristics of an ontology schema as well as its population decision quickly. We present an evaluation of several ontologies and enable users to make an informed using these metrics to demonstrate their applicability.},

Nowadays, many companies need to answer the following questions: How to measure?, When to measure and What to measure?. There have been a lot of efforts made to attempt to answer these questions, and this has resulted in a large amount of data what is sometimes confusing and unclear information. This needs to be properly processed and classified in order to provide a better overview of the current situation. We have used a Measurement Software Ontology to classify and put the amount of data in this field in order. We have also analyzed the results of the systematic review, to show the trends in the software measurement field and the software process on which the measurement efforts have focused. It has allowed us to discover what parts of the process are not supported enough by measurements, to thus motivate future research in those areas.},

Six scales were developed: self-efficacy, active learning strate- gies, science learning value, performance goal, achievement goal, and learning environment stimu- lation. In total, 1407 junior high school students from central Taiwan, varying in grades, sex, and achievements, were selected by stratified random sampling to respond to the questionnaire. The Cronbach alpha for the entire questionnaire was 0.89; for each scale, alpha ranged from 0.70 to 0.89. There were significant correlations (p < 0.01) of the SMTSL questionnaire with students' science attitudes (r = 0.41), and with the science achievement test in previous and current semes- ters (rp = 0.40 and rc = 0.41). High motivators and low motivators showed a significant difference (p <0.01) on their SMTSL scores. Findings of the study confirmed the validity and reliability of the SMTSL questionnaire. Implications for using the SMTSL questionnaire in research and in class are discussed in the paper},

In the last decade there has been an accelerated flow of findings in multiple disciplines supporting a view of affect as complexly intertwined with cognition in guiding rational behaviour, memory retrieval, decision-making, creativity, and more. It is time to redress the imbalance by developing theories and technologies in which affect and cognition are appropriately integrated with one another. This paper describes work in that direction at the MIT Media Lab and projects a large perspective of new research in which computer technology is used to redress the imbalance that was caused (or, at least, accentuated) by the computer itself.},

	abstract = { Agent technology is increasingly being used to develop software systems in different domains. Hence particular design problems are recurring in different multiagent systems development projects. In order to enhance the reuse of proven solutions to recurring design problems, agent design patterns are being identified and documented. Understandably, most of the available work on agent design patterns reflect object oriented concepts (classes, objects, inheritance, etc) and exhibit an implementation bias. It is preferable for these patterns to reflect the notions of agency and be described at the right level of abstraction. In this paper, we present a new agent design pattern classification scheme that is structured to better reflect the notions of agency and allow varying levels of abstraction in describing agent design patterns. We also show how four different agent design patterns fit into our classification scheme.},

In tutor level, the tutor manages the learner model and makes decisions concerning the appropriate activity and dialogue strategy for the learner according to his learner model, which is based on the diagnostic results. In learner level, the learner participates in the construction of his learner model through dialogue activities, which promote reflective learning. The dialogue generator module, which is activated by the diagnostic results, plans the appropriate sequence of dialogue-parts using the dialogue-parts' library and constructs personalized tutorial dialogue. The system promotes learners' personalized reflection to accomplish the learning goals and helps learners to be aware of their reasoning and leads them towards the scientific thought.},

Lability of emotional reactions and their regulation in advance directed and maintained effective collaborative activities in the web-based learning environment. Further, students experienced a wide range of emotions while using the WBLE and especially the nature of interaction during the activities was important antecedent of the affective reactions. This result underlines that although the presence of technology is very obvious in web-based learning environments, it is not, however, prevailing antecedent of the affective reactions experienced while using such learning environments.

A systematic review is a means of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area, or phenomenon of interest. Systematic reviews aim to present a fair evaluation of a research topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology. The guideline presented in this report was derived from three existing guidelines used by medical researchers. The guideline has been adapted to reflect the specific problems of software engineering research. The guideline covers three phases of a systematic review: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. It is at a relatively high level. It does not consider the impact of question type on the review procedures, nor does it specify in detail mechanisms needed to undertake meta-analysis.},

The goal is to develop a set of verbal materials that have been rated in terms of pleasure, arousal, and dominance to complement the existing International Affective Picture System (IAPS, Lang, Bradley, \& Cuthbert, 1999) and International Affective Digitized Sounds (IADS; Bradley \& Lang, 1999), which are collections of picture and sound stimuli, respectively, that also include these affective ratings. The ANEW, IAPS, and IADS are being developed and distributed by NIMH Center for Emotion and Attention (CSEA) investigators Margaret Bradley and Peter Lang, in order to provide standardized materials that are available to researchers in the study of emotion and attention. The existence of these affective collections should help in comparing results across different investigations of emotion, as well as in allowing replication within and across research labs assessing basic or applied problems in the study of emotion.},

The benefits of this approach are multiple: on one hand music producers can increase the exposure of their songs to specific target audiences; on the other hand, music consumers can easily discover new songs that match their preferences and group with people with whom they share similar listening experiences.},

Computational thinking is a universally applicable attitude and skill set that involves solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behavior by drawing on fundamental computer science concepts. It includes using abstraction, decomposition, and various mental tools to approach complex tasks or systems. Computational thinking is essential for everyone, not just computer scientists, and should be added to every child's analytical ability alongside reading, writing, and arithmetic.

- **Computational thinking** is a universally applicable attitude and skill set that builds on computing processes.
- It involves **solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behavior** by drawing on computer science concepts.
- Computational thinking includes **abstraction, decomposition, separation of concerns, and choosing appropriate representations** for problems.
- It also encompasses **performance modeling, independence of failure, and exploiting AI difficulties** to authenticate humans.
- **Thinking recursively, parallel processing, and interpreting code as data** are key aspects of computational thinking.
- It requires **thinking at multiple levels of abstraction**, and is a fundamental skill for everyone.
- Computational thinking is about **solving problems in a human way, not trying to make humans think like computers**.
- Equipped with computing devices, humans can use their **cleverness and imagination** to tackle complex problems and build innovative systems.

workflow: Computational thinking involves solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behavior by drawing on concepts fundamental to computer science. It includes conceptualizing, not programming, and thinking at multiple levels of abstraction. Computational thinking is a fundamental skill for everyone, not just computer scientists, and it complements and combines mathematical and engineering thinking.

diffculties: - Computational thinking involves solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behavior by drawing on computer science concepts.
- It requires thinking at multiple levels of abstraction and is a fundamental skill for everyone.
- Some challenging aspects include reformulating difficult problems into solvable ones, thinking recursively, and parallel processing.
- Computational thinking also involves abstraction, decomposition, separation of concerns, and choosing appropriate representations for problems.
- It requires using invariants to describe system behavior, modularizing for multiple users, and planning for worst-case scenarios through redundancy and error correction.},

	abstract = {With the growing complexity of the man-machine systems the problem of allocation becomes more critical. Little progress has been made towards its solution since the publication of Fitts' article in 1951 which has dominated thinking in this area. Fitts recommended that man be compared to machines and be chosen for those functions which he does better than machines and vice versa. To do so is wrong; when we can compare a man to a machine, we find that we can also build a machine for the function involved. Hence the lack of progress. Men and machines are complementary, rather than comparable. Once the problem is so reformulated, new ways of thinking which appear to be promising open up.

Page 23: "The lesson learned seemed to be that real learning occurs only when new knowledge is put to practice."

Page 25-26: "In most of the cases reported in the literature, the managers or the senior staff handled problem-solving efforts, and hence, problem solving seemed divorced from the actual problem site and became de-contextualized. Objectively validating existing knowledge was not apparent in those efforts even though the effectiveness of all subsequent steps depended on that understanding. In fact, researchers in a recent empirical study note that the problem solvers often assumed the source of the problem without any prior research (Walley and Gowland 2004). Therefore, there was no individual validation of the current process by the problem solver(s) before embarking on the subsequent steps."

Page 25: "The third characteristic of an effective metaroutine is, does the metaroutine encourage joint validation of new knowledge? If the consequences are positive, they confirm the individuals' understanding. If they are negative, the individuals have the opportunity to revise their understanding."},

	annote = {On propositions (p11):
'What we combine by means of the logical operations (\bottom, \implies, \and, \or, orall, \exists) and hold to be true are propositions.'

On judgements (p11):
'When we hold a proposition to be true, we make a judgement.'

On motivation (p12):
'Our aim is to build up a system of formal rules representing in the best possible way informal (mathematical) reasoning.'

On justification (p12):
'A rule of inference is justified by explaining the conclusion on the assumption that the premisses are known. Hence, before a rule of inference can be justified, it must be explained what it is that we must know in order to the the right to make a judgement of any one of the various froms that the premisses and conclusion can have.'

On justification interpretation (p14):
Martin-L{\"o}f's, interpretation is that
* A set means A is a proposition and 
* a\in A means a is a proof (construction) of a proposition A 

On terminology (p14):
'To distinguish between proofs of judgements (usually in tree-like form) and proofs of propositions (here identified with elements to he left of the \in) we reserve the word construction for the latter and use it when confusion might occur. '

On programs (p14):
'The last is very close to programming. 'a is a method...' can be read as 'a is a program...'. Since programming languages have a formal notation for the program a, but not for A, we complete the sentence with '...which meets the specification A'.'

On the meaning of a judgement of the form a \in A:  (p.17)
'an element a of a set A is a method (of program) which, when executed, yields a canonical element of A as result.'
Method is a primitive term.

On the meaning of a judgement of the form a = b \in A (p17):
'the meaning of a judgement of the form a = b \in A: 
two arbitrary elements a, b of a set A are equal if, when executed, a and b yield canonical elements of A as results.'

On propositions (p19):
'a proposition is defined by laying down what counts as a proof of the proposition'
and
'a proposition is true if it has a proof, that is, if a proof of it can be given.'

On the need for canonical forms (note on p15)
10^10 does not contain ', and so cannot be constructed by a rule that only mentions '

On Kolmogorov's interpretation of implies (p25)
'This generalisation is perhaps more evident in the Kolmogorov interpretation, where we might be in the position o judge B to be a problem only under the assumption that the problem A can be solved, which is clearly sufficient for the problem A implies B, that is, the problem of solving B provided that A can be solved, to make sense.'},

The approach is `domain expert-oriented' in the sense that domain expert(s) (in fact, one or more in our approach) can actively participate during the requirements acquisition activity by identifying and by describing the use cases. Rules are proposed during the requirements conceptualization activity and allow the analyst to generate parts of object type state transition diagrams from a use case description.

Keywords: Object-oriented specifications; Petri net; Use case}}

	abstract = {We use the term requirements to denote what are often called functional
	 requirements. Requirements are located in the environment, which
	 is distinguished from the machine to be built. A requirement is a
	 condition over phenomena of the environment. A specification is a
	 restricted form of requirement, providing enough information for the
	 implementer to build the machine (by programming it) without further
	 environment knowledge. To describe requirements appropriately we must fit
	 our descriptions into an appropriate structure. This structure must
	 respect the distinction between the machine and the environment, and
	 the distinction between those environment properties that are given
	 (indicative descriptions) and those that must be achieved by the machine
	 (optative descriptions). Formalisation is a fundamental problem of
	 requirements engineering. Since most environments are parts of the
	 physical world, and therefore informal, the formalisation task is
	 inescapable. Some techniques are discussed for tackling this task. In
	 particular, the use of designations is explained, and the distinction
	 between definition and assertion. By using the smallest possible
	 set of designated terms, augmented by appropriate definitions, the
	 developer can create a narrow bridge between the environment and
	 its descriptions in the requirements. In this way a sufficiently
	 faithful approximation. to the informal reality can be obtained.}}

This approach can also be used for guiding the developer in such a way that undersirable interactions between features can be avoided. In particular, this means that after each important step in the requirements specification process (e.g., after important tasks have been performed), possible interactions can be computed, and the developers can decide how to handle undersable interactions.

In the beginning of this paper, 2 good examples of feature interactions happening in the environment.}}

	title = {The Governor Architecture: Avoiding Catastrophic Forgetting in Robot Learning},
	abstract = {The governor architecture is a new method for avoiding catatrophic forgetting in neural networks that is particularly useful in online robot learn- ing. The governor architecture uses a categorizer to identify events and excise long sequences of repetitive data that cause catastrophic forgetting in neural networks trained on robot-based tasks. We examine the performance of several variations of the governor architecture on a number of re- lated localization tasks using a simulated robot. The results show that governed networks perform far better than ungoverned networks. Governored networks are able to reliably and robustly prevent catastrophic forgetting in robot learning tasks.

This paper introduces an executable system dynamics simulation model developed to help project managers comprehend the complex impacts related to requirements volatility on a software development project. The simulator extends previous research and adds research results from an empirical survey, including over 50 new parameters derived from the associated survey data, to a base model. The paper discusses detailed results from two cases that show significant cost, schedule, and quality impacts as a result of requirements volatility. The simulator can be used as an effective tool to demonstrate the complex set of factor relationships and effects related to requirements volatility.},

In studying the latter, one looks mainly at the responses which precede it. In its reinforcing capacity, a stimulus increases, decreases, or leaves unchanged the frequency of preceding responses, and accordingly it is called a reward, a punishment, or a neutral stimulus (cf. 16). Previous studies using chronic implantation of electrodes have tended to focus on the eliciting functions of electrical stimuli delivered to the brain (2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14). The present study, on the other hand, has been concerned with the reinforcing function of the electrical stimulation.}}

	 organizations to respond quickly to a redefined mission or to new and
	 changing markets. It allows them to accelerate the introduction of new
	 products and improve their quality, to reengineer legacy systems,
	 and to manage and enhance the many product variations needed for
	 international markets. However, technically excellent product line
	 architectures do fail, often because they are not effectively used. Some are
	 developed but never used; others lose value as product teams stop
	 sharing the common architecture; still others achieve initial success,
	 but fail to keep up with a rapidly growing product mix. Sometimes
	 the architecture deterioration is not noticed at first, masked by
	 what appears to be a productivity increase. To learn what factors
	 determine the effective use of software architecture, the authors
	 looked at Nortel (Northern Telecom), a company with nearly 20 years of
	 experience developing complex software architecture for telecommunications
	 product families. They identified six principles that help reduce
	 the complexity of an evolving family of products and that support
	 and maintain the effective use and integrity of the architecture}}

	 perspective is applied to software reuse. An application domain is
	 represented by a family of systems that have some features in common and
	 others that differentiate them. A domain model is a problem-oriented
	 architecture that captures the similarities and variations of the family of
	 systems that compose the application domain. Because the application
	 domain requirements capture the composite features of the members of
	 the family, they are categorized as kernel (required by all family
	 members) or optional (required by some family members). It is the
	 optional features that determine the characteristics of a given target
	 system. The relationship between the domain requirements and the object
	 types in the domain model are captured by means of feature/object
	 dependencies, which define the object types and prerequisite features
	 needed to support a given feature. Software architectures are reused
	 by selecting those features required in a target system and then
	 tailoring the domain model, subject to the appropriate feature/object
	 dependency constraints, to generate the target system specification.}}

	abstract = {{Increasingly, software organisations are
	 looking towards large- scale reuse as a way of improving productivity,
	 raising quality and reducing delivery timescales. Many in the reuse
	 community have suggested notions of product-line development and domain
	 engineering life-cycles. Achieving these in practice, however, requires a
	 systematic process for "early" reuse (requirements reuse) as well as
	 late reuse (code reuse). This paper discusses pratical experience of
	 early reuse. We describe FORE (Family Of REquirements), an approach
	 that we have developed in our work in the domain of aircraft engine
	 control systems. The FORE approach concentrates on the definition of a
	 generic product concept and the formalisation of its requirements. We
	 describe the FORE approach in general terms, and then show how it
	 has been applied in an industrial case-study. We make an initial
	 evaluation of the FORE approach (and early reuse in general) in terms of
	 how it has changed an existing requirements engineering process. We
	 compare the FORE approach to related work in early reuse, and draw
	 some conclusions about how the approach may scale to other problems.}}}

	 reuse are hard to evaluate from a software safety perspective. This
	 paper reports experience specifying an interferometer (telescope)
	 subsystem as a product family and supplementing the specification with
	 results from a failure analysis. Extensions to the product family
	 approach, with lessons learned, are discussed in three areas: (I)
	 integration of safety analysis with the product family approach; (2)
	 modeling decisions that have safety implications (e.g., how to handle
	 near-commonalities, establishing a hierarchy of variabilities, and
	 specifying dependencies among options); and (3) use of the product family
	 requirements for design evaluation of reusable components as well as a
	 specific product. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.}}

	 recognize that reuse is a design characteristic that must be planned for,
	 reusability is not an inherent property of software. One such initiative is
	 product-line development, which seeks to achieve reuse across a domain, or
	 family, of systems. We used product-line development on a demonstration
	 project to develop real-time training systems for flight crews. The $14
	 million demonstration project revealed that product-line development
	 requires a mature process and a sophisticated support environment}}

	abstract = {Software productivity has been
	 steadily increasing over the past 30 years, but not enough to close the
	 gap between the demands placed on the software industry and what
	 the state of the practice can deliver; nothing short of an order of
	 magnitude increase in productivity will extricate the software industry
	 from its perennial crisis. Several decades of intensive research in
	 software engineering and artificial intelligence left few alternatives
	 but software reuse as the (only) realistic approach to bring about
	 the gains of productivity and quality that the software industry
	 needs. In this paper, we discuss the implications of reuse on the
	 production, with an emphasis on the technical challenges. Software reuse
	 involves building software that is reusable by design and building
	 with reusable software. Software reuse includes reusing both the
	 products of previous software projects and the processes deployed to
	 produce them, leading to a wide spectrum of reuse approaches, from the
	 building blocks (reusing products) approach, on one hand, to the
	 generative or reusable processor (reusing processes), on the other.
	 We discuss the implication of such approaches on the organization,
	 control, and method of software development and discuss proposed
	 models for their economic analysis. Software reuse benefits from
	 methodologies and tools to: (1) build more readily reusable software and
	 (2) locate, evaluate, and tailor reusable software, the last being
	 critical for the building blocks approach. Both sets of issues are
	 discussed in this paper, with a focus on application generators and OO
	 development for the first and a thorough discussion of retrieval
	 techniques for software components, component composition (or bottom-up
	 design), and transformational systems for the second. We conclude by
	 highlighting areas that, in our opinion, are worthy of further investigation}}

	 retrieves the appropriate generic model from the system library. The
	 algorithms of the matcher, which implement a computational theory of
	 analogical structure matching, are described. A theory of domain
	 knowledge is proposed to define the semantics and composition of generic
	 domain models in the context of requirements engineering. A modeling
	 language and a library of models arranged in families of classes are
	 described. The models represent the basic transaction processing or

	 are given to distinguish between families and hierarchical levels.
	 Related work and future directions of the domain theory are discussed. }}

	abstract = {The software product-line approach (for software product families) is
	 one of the success stories of software reuse. When applied, it can
	 result in cost savings and increases in productivity. In addition, in
	 safety-critical systems the approach has the potential for reuse
	 of analysis and testing results, which can lead to a safer system.
	 Nevertheless, there are times when it seems like a product family approach
	 should work when, in fact, there are difficulties in properly defining
	 the boundaries of the product family. In this paper, we draw on our
	 experiences in applying the software product-line approach to a family of
	 mobile robots, a family of flight guidance systems, and a family of
	 cardiac pacemakers, as well as case studies done by others to (1)
	 illustrate how domain structure can currently limit applicability of
	 product-line approaches to certain domains and (2) demonstrate our progress
	 towards a solution using a set-theoretic approach to reason about
	 domains of what we call n-dimensional and hierarchical product families}}

	 industrial communities has been to seek ways systematically to engineer
	 software domains. One approach is to develop families of software and to
	 invest in facilities for rapidly producing family members. Success in
	 such an endeavor requires that the software engineers be able to
	 identify the desired family members. This tutorial describes the
	 commonality analysis process, a systematic approach to analyzing
	 families. Commonality analysis was developed at Bell Labs and is being
	 tried in Lucent Technologies as part of a process for engineering
	 domains that is known as family-oriented abstraction, specification,
	 and translation (FAST). The result of the analysis forms the basis
	 for designing reusable assets that can be used to produce rapidly
	 family members. The tutorial teaches the participants the principles
	 underlying the approach and gives them a chance to perform a practice
	 commonality analysis guided by experienced users of the process.}}

	 decomposition of problems that allows us to relate requirements, domain
	 properties, and machine specifications. Having decomposed a problem, one
	 approach to solving it is through a process of composing solutions to
	 sub-problems. In this paper, we contribute to supporting such a process by
	 providing a way to compose multiple Problem Frames. We develop a
	 systematic approach to composing inconsistent requirements. We introduce
	 Composition Frames, a requirements construct that models relevant
	 aspects of composition and thus deals with unwanted effects, such as
	 interference of overlapping reactions to events. Throughout the paper
	 we use a simple case study to illustrate and validate our ideas.}}

	 requirements. We present a new approach to reusing requirements based on
	 application families i.e. several systems in a given problem domain. In
	 contrast to precious approaches, an application family model in our
	 approach consists of a pool of requirements (linked in a lattice
	 structure), a domain model and a set of discriminants (a special kind of
	 requirement that differentiate one system from another). We focus on how to
	 make an efficient and clean selection of the requirements for a new
	 system from an application family model. We have developed a method
	 for solving this problem and a prototypical tool for supporting it.
	 The method and the prototype were successfully developed under a
	 study contract for ESA (European Space Agency). We present a case
	 study, where we generated commanding requirements for an individual
	 mission from an application family model of commanding requirements for
	 spacecraft control operating systems. As a consequence, we propose
	 this approach for reusing requirements based an application families}}

	 products, and for creating better estimations of the development
	 process. Most product line development processes rely on performing
	 a domain analysis to find out commonalities among proposed family

	 system. Despite active research efforts to close this, gap there
	 is still no effective method that allows product specifications in
	 arbitrary levels of detail for a hierarchical product family. In
	 particular, it is not possible to combine different specification
	 mechanisms to produce a complete family specification. The authors
	 approach these problems by presenting a method that allows system
	 specifications both in the product line variant as well as the product
	 family level. This exposes many problems in managing consistency
	 between different methods to specify families of systems. To achieve
	 this, our method offers derivation of consistency management support
	 between different specification levels and among family variants}}

	 describe abstract behaviours of components using CSP-like notations,
	 characterisations of styles using predicates over system instances
	 + introduce techniques to support the analysis of large systems,
	 demonstrate WRIGHT's expressiveness and practicality with 3 case studies}}

	 approach that incorporates a business strategy dimension. We employ both
	 goal modeling and Jackson's Problem Frames approach to achieve this.
	 Jackson's context diagrams, used to represent the business model
	 context, are integrated with goal-models to describe the complete
	 business strategy. We leverage the paradigm of projection in both
	 approaches while maintaining traceability to high-level business
	 objectives as a means of simultaneously decomposing both the optative
	 and indicative parts of the requirements problem, from an abstract
	 business level to concrete system requirements. We integrate use of role
	 activity diagrams to describe business processes in detail where
	 needed. The feasibility of our approach is shown by a case study.}}

	abstract = { A refinement calculus is introduced to
	 support the top-down development of concurrent systems of a type which
	 abstracts occam's communication structure. The main idea is to use the
	 weakest-environment concept to decompose a concurrent system R into its
	 communicating components: given one component P of R, and a communication
	 interface between P and its partner Q, the weakest possible Q is
	 calculated which, in parallel with P, achieves R. The development of R
	 is thereby decomposed into the development of its components. Laws
	 to support such developments are given in terms of combinators of

	year = {2003},
	abstract = {In this paper, we present an approach using problem frames to analyse security
	 problems in order to determine security threats and vulnerabilities. We
	 use problem frames to capture and bound the base system that is to
	 be protected. We consider threats to this base problem frame from
	 the point of view of the attacker. For each class of threats, their
	 successful realisation is regarded as the anti-requirement in an
	 abuse frame. Antirequirements are quantified existentially: that is,
	 the attacker succeeds by realising the threat in any one instance.
	 For a threat to be realised, its abuse frame must be composed with
	 the base problem frame in the sense that the asset attacked in the
	 abuse frame must overlap, or be identified with, a domain of the
	 base problem frame. We explain the process of composition and some
	 of its variations. We illustrate and assess our approach using a
	 case study of a medical information system, and suggest how abuse
	 frames can provide a means for bounding the scope of and reasoning
	 about security problems in order to analyse security threats and
	 identify vulnerabilities. We conclude with an agenda for future work.}}

	title = {The Engineering Roles of Requirements and Specification},
	abstract = {The distinction between requirements and specification in software engineering is often confused in practice. This obstructs the system validation process, because it is unclear what exactly should be validated, and against what it should be validated. The reference model of Gunter et al. addresses this difficulty by providing a framework within which requirements can be distinguished from specification. It separates world phenomena (those of the requirements) from machine phenomena (those of the specification). However, it does not explain how the characterization can be used in practice to help assure system validity. In this paper, we enhance the reference model of Gunter et al. to account for certain key elements that are necessary for the link between requirements and specification. We use the enhanced version to present a more refined picture of validity, where validation has two steps that can be undertaken separately. We use this picture to question whether the \enquote{what the system will do, not how it will do it} paradigm is a useful one in describing how to construct a specification, and propose an alternative. Finally, we present the requirements and specification we developed for an illustrative example based on a runway incursion prevention system, with the ArchiTRIO formal language in a UML-like environment, to show how this might be done in practical systems.},

Design patterns provide one method of software reuse, which supports the goal of improved software development productivity. The prototype system represents an initial step towards providing an automated solution regarding the design pattern application problem, i.e. leading a designer to a suitable design pattern which is applicable to the problem at hand. The feasibility of using expert system technology to aid in the selection problem is demonstrated. },

	abstract = { Abstract: A new approach based on the computation of a fuzzy similarity index (FSI) is presented for the detection of electrocardiogram (ECG) beats. Four types of ECG beats (normal beat, congestive heart failure beat, ventricular tachyarrhythmia beat, atrial fibrillation beat) obtained from the Physiobank database were analysed. The ECG signals were decomposed into time-frequency representations using the discrete wavelet transform and wavelet coefficients were calculated to represent the signals. The aim of the study is detection of ECG beats by the combination of wavelet coefficients and the FSI. Toward achieving this aim, fuzzy sets were obtained from the feature sets (wavelet coefficients) of the signals under study. The results demonstrated that the similarity between the fuzzy sets of the studied signals indicated the variabilities in the ECG signals. Thus, the FSI could discriminate the normal beat and the other three types of beats (congestive heart failure beat, ventricular tachyarrhythmia beat, atrial fibrillation beat). },

	abstract = { Abstract: Treatment planning is a crucial and complex task in the social services industry. There is an increasing need for knowledge-based systems for supporting caseworkers in the decision-making of treatment planning. This paper presents a hybrid case-based reasoning approach for building a knowledge-based treatment planning system for adolescent early intervention of mental healthcare. The hybrid case-based reasoning approach combines aspects of case-based reasoning, rule-based reasoning and fuzzy theory. The knowledge base of case-based reasoning is a case base of client records consisting of documented experience while that for rule-based reasoning is a set of IF-THEN rules based on the experience of social service professionals. Fuzzy theory is adopted to deal with the uncertain nature of treatment planning. A prototype system has been implemented in a social services company and its performance is evaluated by a group of caseworkers. The results indicate that hybrid case-based reasoning has an enhanced performance and the knowledge-based treatment planning system enables caseworkers to construct more efficient treatment planning in less cost and less time. },

The expert system monitors sensor data collected by local monitoring stations and reasons about the current level of water suitability for various aquatic uses, such as swimming and piscicultures. The aim of the expert system is to help the authorities in the decision-making process in the battle against pollution of the aquatic environment, which is vital for public health and the economy of northern Greece. The expert system determines, using fuzzy logic, when certain environmental parameters exceed certain pollution limits, which are specified either by the authorities or by environmental scientists, and flags up appropriate alerts. },

	abstract = { Abstract: This study proposes an early warning system (EWS) for detection of financial crisis with a daily financial condition indicator (DFCI) designed to monitor the financial markets and provide warning signals. The proposed EWS differs from other commonly used EWSs in two aspects: (i) it is based on dynamic daily movements of the financial markets; and (ii) it is established as a pattern classifier, which identifies predefined unstable states in terms of financial market volatility. Indeed it issues warning signals on a daily basis by judging whether the financial market has entered a predefined unstable state or not. The major strength of a DFCI is that it can issue timely warning signals while other conventional EWSs must wait for the next round input of monthly or quarterly information. Construction of a DFCI consists of two steps where machine learning algorithms are expected to play a significant role, i.e. (i) establishing sub-DFCIs on various daily financial variables by an artificial neural network, and (ii) integrating the sub-DFCIs into an integrated DFCI by a genetic algorithm. The DFCI for the Korean financial market is built as an empirical case study. },

The concept of design process plays a very significant role at the outset of the expert system development process. This concept has not been the subject of much debate and attention in expert systems development. From the author's point of view, one of the main issues is how the designer (knowledge engineer) thinks about the design process. In general, the designer's process is influenced by the knowledge engineer's conception. This paper endeavors to disclose some of the main factors related to the knowledge engineer's conception of the design process and an attempt is made to put forward a conceptual model of the expert system design process. This conceptual model is an initial step towards a successful implementation of expert system projects. },

	abstract = {The conventional ways of building software are accepted to 
produce rigid systems that impede the processes of change 
typical for contemporary organisations. In this paper, we 
propose that software can be made more adaptable and 
tuned to the needs of changing organisations, if it is built us- 
ing organisation-inspired principles and software structures 
such as Virtual Organisations, roles and norms. Agent- 
based software engineering is already using these principles, 
and we extend the state of the art in that domain by propos- 
ing an \enquote{open systems} approach, where agents can join and 
leave Virtual Organisations at will, taking on different roles 
as needed. Reasoning on organisational roles and norms is 
facilitated by formalised contract templates and automatic 
conflict resolution strategies. In terms of overall lifecycle, a 
system is initiated to satisfy a set of formalised requirements. 
Agents respond to bids for joining a Virtual Organisation, 
where each bid is for a contract-based coalition. In this pa- 
per, we describe our approach and outline a set of research

	abstract = {Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs) is a language for the modelling and validation of systems in which concurrency, communication, and synchronisation play a major role. Coloured Petri Nets is a discrete-event modelling language combining Petri nets with the functional programming language Standard ML. Petri nets provide the foundation of the graphical notation and the basic primitives for modelling concurrency, communication, and synchronisation. Standard ML provides the primitives for the definition of data types, describing data manipulation, and for creating compact and parameterisable models. A CPN model of a system is an executable model representing the states of the system and the events (transitions) that can cause the system to change state. The CPN language makes it possible to organise a model as a set of modules, and it includes a time concept for representing the time taken to execute events in the modelled system. CPN Tools is an industrial-strength computer tool for constructing and analysing CPN models. Using CPN Tools, it is possible to investigate the behaviour of the modelled system using simulation, to verify properties by means of state space methods and model checking, and to conduct simulation-based performance analysis. User interaction with CPN Tools is based on direct manipulation of the graphical representation of the CPN model using interaction techniques, such as tool palettes and marking menus. A license for CPN Tools can be obtained free of charge, also for commercial use.},

	year = {1998},
	abstract = {A key idea followed in the software and system safety community is that an identified hazard is best dealt with by changing the requirements of the system so that the hazard does not even occur. This modus operandi creates a serious dilemma. The hazard identification, that is needed in order to know what hazards to avoid, is best done after the code has been written, because only then are the potential effects of any particular stimulus, event, etc. deducible. However, if the response to the identified hazard is to change the requirements, then this requirements change will happen only after the code is written. Such changes are both expensive and dangerous. So, a means to identify all hazards at requirements analysis time is needed},

methods. The challenges and opportunities in validation 
are illustrated by drawing an analogy to medical re- 
search and development. Specific validation practices 
such as clinical studies and use of models of human 
disease are discussed, including specific ways to adapt 
them to engineering design. The implications are ex- 
plored for three active areas of design research: robust 
design, axiomatic design, and design decision making. It 
is argued that medical research and development has 
highly-developed, well-documented validation methods 
and that many specific practices such as natural experi- 
ments and model-based evaluations can profitably be 
adapted for use in engineering design research.airplane manufacturers and in their government coun- 
terparts (e.g., NASA). Early-stage design decisions are 
characterized by uncertainty and ambiguity and, espe- 
cially in large organizations, later design decisions are 
made through processes involving teams with a variety 
of experiences, skill, and information. In such circum- 
stances, it can be challenging to establish the benefits of 
new methods. },

	abstract = {The design process for large aerospace vehicles is discussed, with particular emphasis on structural design. Problems with current procedures are identified. Then, the contributions possible from automating the design process (defined as the best combination of men and computers) are considered. Progress toward automated design in the aerospace and other communities is reviewed, including NASA studies of the potential development of Integrated Programs for Aerospace-Vehicle Design (IPAD). The need for and suggested directions of future research on the design process, both technical and social, are discussed. Although much progress has been made to exploit the computer in design, it is concluded that technology is available to begin using the computer to speed communications and management as well as calculations in the design process and thus build man-computer teams that can design better, faster and cheaper.},

	abstract = { We propose an interface design process compatible with scenario-based design 
methods, but specifically intended to facilitate three primary goals: design 
knowledge reuse, comparison of design products, and long-term research 
growth within HCI. This effort describes a computer-aided design tool suite, 
LINK-UP, which supports the design process for specific genre of systems 
that cross many domains---notification systems. We describe the vision for 
LINK-UP, contrasting underlying concepts with typical task-based modeling 
approaches. To achieve its stated goals, the design process is organized and 
guided by critical parameters, presenting several challenges that we reflect on 
through the results of a design simulation study. The possibilities envisioned 
through this approach have important implications for the integration of 
reusable design knowledge, HCI processes, and design support tools.},

	abstract = {This article presents an economic model that determines the optimal amount to invest to protect 
a given set of information. The model takes into account the vulnerability of the information to 
a security breach and the potential loss should such a breach occur. It is shown that for a given 
potential loss, a firm should not necessarily focus its investments on information sets with the 
highest vulnerability. Since extremely vulnerable information sets may be inordinately expensive 
to protect, a firm may be better off concentrating its efforts on information sets with midrange 
vulnerabilities. The analysis further suggests that to maximize the expected benefit from invest- 
ment to protect information, a firm should spend only a small fraction of the expected loss due to 
a security breach.

	volume = {74},
	year = {2005},
	abstract = {Over the past three years, we have been actively engaged in both software reliability growth modeling and architecture-based 
software reliability modeling for projects at Lucent Technologies. Our goal has been to include software into the overall reliability 
evaluation of a product design using either or both of these two fundamentally different approaches. During the course of our 
application efforts to real projects, we have identified practical difficulties with each approach. The application of software reliability 
growth models, for example, is plagued by widespread use of ad hoc test environments, and the use of architecture-based software 
reliability models is plagued by a large number of unknown parameters. In this paper, we discuss our methods for overcoming these 
and other practical difficulties. In particular, we show how calibration factors can be defined and used to adjust for the mismatch 
between the test and operational profiles of the software. We also present two useful ways to do sensitivity analyses that help 
alleviate the problem of so many uncertainties in the architecture-based modeling approach. We illustrate our methods with case 
studies, and offer comments on further work that is required to more satisfactorily bridge the gap between theory and applications in 
this research area.},

to the concept of the smart home. Behind such 
automation, there is a lot of software control- 
ling the appliances. This software, often 
referred to as services, applications, or bundles, 
is supplied by a range of service provider busi- 
nesses. Hence, in a single home, appliances 
may be controlled by a multitude of services 
offered by a wide variety of different providers. 
Moreover, some services may require the use 
of other services. Importantly, these businesses 
are completely independent and may not even 
be aware of one another or their products. 
Hence, appliances may be controlled by more 
than one service, and indeed these controlling 
services are often trying to achieve different 
goals. This causes compatibility issues that 
need to be resolved for networked appliances 
to be successful in the mass market. This prob- 
lem is well known in telephony and historically 
is referred to as the feature interaction problem. 
This article discusses the issue of compatibility 
between services in a home environment. Rea- 
sons why andhow services interact are dis- 
cussed, and a taxonomy of interactions is 
presented. Finally, an approach is presented 
that prevents interactions. The approach pre- 
sented uses accepted and known device and 
protocol interworking techniques. Throughout 
the article a number of example scenarios are 
used to illustrate the issues. However, the 
emphasis of the article is not only to present 
sample services for controlling home appli- 
ances or identify specific interactions between 
such services, but to find a general solution to 
the feature interaction problem that can auto- 
maticallydetect interactions between services 
in the home. },

be enhanced by embedding data and knowledge from past experiences. Tradi- 
tionally, this involves applying scenarios, usability analysis, or the use of  
metrics for risk analysis. In this paper, we present an approach that uses the in- 
formation from incident investigations to inform the development of safety- 
cases that can, in turn, be used to inform a formal system model, represented 
using Petri nets and the ICO formalism.  The foundations of the approach are 
first detailed and then exemplified using a fatal mining accident case study.},

	title = {How Engineering Extends the Statement View},
	abstract = {We adapt the Carnapian framework for science, the so called Statement View, to describe the 
normative framework of engineering. In particular, we use the terminology of the Statement View 
to explain the process by which an engineer, in a conventional design activity, envisions a new 
artefact in terms of a hypothetical extension of the existing reality, as described by the underlying 
science. The language ohf the underlying science incorporates sublanguages for referring to 
observables and theoretical terms. The hypothetical extension of the underlying science adds new 
observables and, potentially, new theoretical terms. The process of designing and creating the new 
artefact and the extended, new reality in which it exists, may be seen as a systematic manipulation 
of this hypothesised reality to describe the various artefacts of design and the hypothesised artefact 
itself and their relationships to each other and to the engineering process itself. This `altered 
reality' view of engineering may also be seen, in meta theoretical terms, as the systematic manipulation of the Ramsey sentence corresponding to the hypothesised artefact. },

	abstract = {The authors explore whether the need for ethical reflection on the part of 
designing engineers is dependent on the type of design process. They use 
Vincenti's (1992) distinction between normal and radical design and different 
levels of design hierarchy. These two dimensions are coupled with the concept 
of ill-structured problems, which are problems in which possible solutions 
cannot be ordered on a scale from better to worse. Design problems are better 
structured at lower hierarchical levels and in cases of normal design. Better 
structured design problems require less ethical reflection on the part of 
designing engineers if such situations are characterized by the existence of 
generally accepted normative frameworks. Engineers could then deal with 
moral problems within the bounds of such frameworks and without the need 
for further reflection. On the basis of a number of empirical cases,the authors 
explore whether these ideas hold water. They discuss four cases ranging from 
a high-level radical design process to a low-level normal design process.},

	abstract = {This paper is an attempt to describe the nature of a new calculative background 
that is currently coming into existence, a background that will both guide 
and constitute what counts as `thinking'. It begins by providing a capsule history 
of how this background has become a more and more pervasive quality of 
Euro-American cultures as a result of the rise of `qualculation'. It then moves 
on to consider how this qualculative background is producing new apprehensions 
of space and time before ending by considering how new kinds of sensorium 
may now be becoming possible. In this final section, I illustrate my argument 
by considering the changing presence of the hand, co-ordinate systems and 
language, thereby attempting to conjure up the lineaments of a new kind of 
movement-space.

	volume = {152},
	year = {2005},
	abstract = {In order to have a software architecture design method that achieves quality attribute 
requirements several aspects of the method must be in place. First there must be some way to 
specify quality attribute requirements so that it can be determined whether the designed architecture 
can achieve them. Secondly, there must be some way for modularising the knowledge associated 
with quality attributes so that the design method does not need to know how to reason about all of 
the multiplicity of quality attributes that exist. Finally, there must be some way for managing the 
interactions among the quality attributes so that either the requirements can be satisfied or the ones 
that cannot be satisfied are identified. The authors describe a structure called a `reasoning 
framework' as a modularisation of quality attribute knowledge. The requirements that the 
architecture must satisfy are specified as concrete quality attribute scenarios. Each reasoning 
framework provides mechanisms that will transform the architecture with respect to a given quality 
attribute theory. Within a reasoning framework, the authors distinguish between an architectural 
model and a quality attribute model and characterise the actions that a reasoning framework 
undertakes as basic architectural transformations. Finally, the process of identifying interactions 
among reasoning frameworks is begun so that conflicting requirements can be managed. The use of 
reasoning frameworks is situated inside an existing architectural design method so that a useful 
method exists while the open issues of designing to achieve quality attribute requirements are 
resolved. },

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to build the foundation 
for software architecture. We first develop an intuition 
for software architecture by appealing to several well- 
established architectural disciplines. On the basis of 
this intuition, we present a model of software architec- 
ture that consists of three components: elements, form, 
and rationale. Elements are either processing, data, or 
connecting elements. Form is defined in terms of the 
properties of, and the relationships among, the elements 
-- that is, the constraints on the elements. The ratio- 
nale provides the underlying basis for the architecture in 
terms of the system constraints, which most often derive 
from the system :requirements. We discuss the compo- 
nents of the model in the context of both architectures 
and architectural styles and present an extended exam- 
ple to illustrate some important architecture and style 
considerations. We conclude by presenting some of the 
benefits of our approach to software architecture, sum- 
marizing our contributions, and relating our approach 
to other current work. 
more toward integrating designs and the design process 
into the broader context of the software process and 
its management. One result of this integration was that 
many of the notations and techniques developed for soft- 
ware design have been absorbed by implementation lan- 
guages. Consider, for example, the concept of support- 
ing programmming-in-the-large. This integration has 
tended to blur, if not confuse, the distinction between 
design and implementation. 
The 1980s also saw great advances in our ability to 
describe and analyze software systems. We refer here to 
such things as formal descriptive techniques and sophis- 
ticated notions of typing that enable us to reason more 
effectively about software systems. For example, we are 
able to reason about consistency and inconsistency
more effectively and we are able to talk about type 
conformance 1 rather than just type equivalence. 
The 1990s, we believe, will be the decade of software 
architecture. We use the term architecture, in con- 
trast to design, to evoke notions of codification, of 
abstraction, of standards, of formal training (of soft-

	abstract = {Architectures for software use rich abstractions and 
idioms to describe system components, the nature of interac- 
tions among the components, and the patterns that guide the 
composition of components into systems. These abstractions are 
higher level than the elements usually supported by programming 
languages and tools. They capture packaging and interaction 
issues as well as computational functionality. Well-established 
(if informal) patterns guide architectural design of systems. We 
sketch a model for defining architectures and present an imple- 
mentation of the basic level of that model. Our purpose is to 
support the abstractions used in practice by software designers. 
The implementation provides a testbed for experiments with 
a variety of system construction mechanisms. It distinguishes 
among different types of components and different ways these 
components can interact. It supports abstract interactions such as 
data flow and scheduling on the same footing as simple procedure 
call. It can express and check appropriate compatibility restric- 
tions and configuration constraints. It accepts existing code as 
components, incurring no runtime overhead after initialization. It 
allows easy incorporation of specifications and associated analysis 
tools developed elsewhere. The implementation provides a base 
for extending the notation and validating the model.

	title = {Integrating Computer Algebra into Proof Planning},
	year = {1998},
	abstract = {Mechanized reasoning systems and computer algebra systems have different objectives. 
Their integration is highly desirable, since formal proofs often involve both of the two different tasks 
proving and calculating. Even more important, proof and computation are often interwoven and not 
easily separable. 
In this article we advocate an integration of computer algebra into mechanized reasoning sys- 
tems at the proof plan level. This approach allows us to view the computer algebra algorithms as 
methods, that is, declarative representations of the problem-solving knowledge specific to a certain 
mathematical domain. Automation can be achieved in many cases by searching for a hierarchic proof 
plan at the method level by using suitable domain-specific control knowledge about the mathematical 
algorithms. In other words, the uniform framework of proof planning allows us to solve a large class 
of problems that are not automatically solvable by separate systems. 
Our approach also gives an answer to the correctness problems inherent in such an integration. 
We advocate an approach where the computer algebra system produces high-level protocol informa- 
tion that can be processed by an interface to derive proof plans. Such a proof plan in turn can be 
expanded to proofs at different levels of abstraction, so the approach is well suited for producing a 
high-level verbalized explication as well as for a low-level, machine-checkable, calculus-level proof. 
We present an implementation of our ideas and exemplify them using an automatically solved 
example. 
Changes in the criterion of `rigor of the proof ' 
engender major revolutions in mathematics.

	abstract = {IMPS is an interactive mathematical proof system intended as a general-purpose tool for formulating and applying mathematics in a familiar fashion. The logic of IMPS is based on a version of simple type theory with partial functions and subtypes. Mathematical specification and inference are performed relative to axiomatic theories, which can be related to one another via inclusion and theory interpretation. IMPS provides relatively large primitive inference steps to facilitate human control of the deductive process and human comprehension of the resulting proofs. An initial theory library containing over a thousand repeatable proofs covers significant portions of logic, algebra, and analysis and provides some support for modeling applications in computer science.},

upon the present state of how controlled experiments in software engineering are conducted and the extent to which relevant 
information is reported. Among the 5,453 scientific articles published in 12 leading software engineering journals and conferences in 
the decade from 1993 to 2002, 103 articles (1.9 percent) reported controlled experiments in which individuals or teams performed one 
or more software engineering tasks. This survey quantitatively characterizes the topics of the experiments and their subjects (number 
of subjects, students versus professionals, recruitment, and rewards for participation), tasks (type of task, duration, and type and size 
of application) and environments (location, development tools). Furthermore, the survey reports on how internal and external validity is 
addressed and the extent to which experiments are replicated. The gathered data reflects the relevance of software engineering

The interpreted Petri net is considered as a main, initial specification format for programmable logic controller programs. The Gentzen system allows one to naturally simulate and denote the human reasoning and clearly perform symbolic transformations. In such a way, it is possible to combine mathematical clarity with practical usefulness. The specification in the form of symbolic expressions may be transformed into a format accepted by standard tools (PLD compilers, VHDL, PLC programming languages) as well as into the standard Boolean expressions.}}

	 but there are four areas in which the foundation of the discipline
	 seems weak or obscure. This article shines some light in the 'four
	 dark corners,' exposing problems and proposing solutions. We show
	 that all descriptions involved in requirements engineering should
	 be descriptions of the environment. We show that certain control
	 information is necessary for sound requirements engineering, and we explain
	 the close association between domain knowledge and refinement of
	 requirements. Together these conclusions explain the precise nature of
	 requirements, specifications, and domain knowledge, as well as the
	 precise nature of the relationships among them. They establish minimum
	 standards for what information should be represented in a requirements
	 language. They also make it possible to determine exactly what it
	 means for requirements engineering to be successfully completed.},
