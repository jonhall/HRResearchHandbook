	year = {2021},
	abstract = {Purpose: The paper aims to provide methodological support for hybrid project management, in which the discipline of predictive methodologies combines with the flexibility of adaptive ones. Specifically, the paper explores the extent to which complexity and volatility dimensions of organisational problems inform choices of PM methodologies both theoretically and in current practice, as a first step towards better methodological support for hybridisation.
Design/methodology/approach: The paper takes a mixed method approach, including both an in-depth analysis of the literature and primary research with practitioners. Primary research consists of a small scale survey (n = 31) followed by semi-structured interviews, with findings triangulated against evidence from the literature review.
Findings: The paper provides empirical insights on how complexity and volatility of organisational problems can inform hybrid project management practices. Specifically, it suggests a mapping between volatility and complexity dimensions, and predictive and adaptive risk controls, systematising hybrid combinations in projects.
Research limitations/implications: Due to the small participant sample, the research results may lack generalis- ability.

Lack of relevant methodologies is an acknowledged barrier, alongside key skills shortage and other organisational cultural traits. To address this gap, we propose an approach to BA which marries data analytics with an established complex problem solving framework with a track record of successful organisational application. We provide an account of its recent use within a UK higher education institution, and reflect on how it has contributed to increasing the institution's BA readiness and maturity.},

	abstract = {In project management, initial requirements definition takes place in the front-end phase, where the uncertainties are highest and decisions have the biggest influence; this constitutes a considerable process risk, risk that can, however, be mitigated by ensuring that requirements are validated and understood by stakeholders before starting with the development of the solution. This research investigates approaches to the front-end phase of IT/business alignment projects which incorporate this type of risk mitigation. We use an initial exploratory case study to apply one such approach, Problem Oriented Engineering (POE). The case study is retrospective, applied to the front-end phase of an IT/business alignment project. The case study shows that POE can be applied to model all process steps in the real-life project, identifying the related relevant stakeholders and their involvement in the process. Specific validation points and their outcomes could also be modelled. Additionally, the case study demonstrated that problem diagrams can provide suitable models of concepts in their organisational context, with associated requirements to be satisfied. Although retrospective, the outcome of the pilot research is encouraging: POE gave an indication of when development risk was accumulated and the extent of related sunk costs when concepts were rejected by stakeholders. Future research should assess the extent POE models can be used in practice to allow stakeholders to understand better identified concepts, the rationale for their choice and their impact on the organisation. Our conclusion is that this type of analysis has the potential to become a powerful project management tool that can be applied to the front-end phase of project, with the purpose of systematising concept identification and evaluation, and in this way reducing development risk.},

	abstract = {Abstract Safety-critical systems are becoming more widespread, complex and reliant on software. Increasingly they are engineered through (COTS) (Commercial Off The Shelf) components to alleviate the spiralling costs and development time, often in the context of complex supply chains. A parallel increased concern for safety has resulted in a variety of safety standards, with a growing consensus that a safety life cycle is needed which is fully integrated with the design and development life cycle, to ensure that safety has appropriate influence on the design decisions as system development progresses. In this article we explore the application of an integrated approach to safety engineering in which assurance drives the engineering process. The paper reports on the outcome of a case study on a live industrial project with a view to evaluate: its suitability for application in a real-world safety engineering setting; its benefits and limitations in counteracting some of the difficulties of safety engineering with (COTS) components across supply chains; and, its effectiveness in generating evidence which can contribute directly to the construction of safety cases. },

	abstract = {Abstract. Many organisational problems are addressed through change and re-engineering of existing Information Systems rather than radical new design. In the face of up to 70\% IT project failure, devising effective ways to tackle this type of change remains an open challenge. The paper discusses the motivation, theoretical foundation, characteristics and evaluation of a novel framework - referred to as POE-$\Delta$, which is rooted in design and engineering and is aimed at providing systematic support for representing, structuring and exploring change problems of socio- technical nature. We generalise an existing theory of greenfield design as problem solving for application to change problems, using a design science research methodology. From a theoretical perspective POE-$\Delta$ is a subset of its parent framework, allowing the seamless integration of greenfield and brownfield design to tackle change problems. Its initial case study evaluation, consisting in its application to a real-world change problem of realistic complexity, shows that POE-$\Delta$ allows the systematic analysis of change problems, leading to clearer understanding and more informed decision making.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Many organisational problems are addressed through change and re-engineering of existing Information Systems rather than radical new design. In the face of up to 70\% IT project failure, devising effective ways to tackle this type of change remains an open challenge. The paper discusses the motivation, theoretical foundation, characteristics and evaluation of a novel framework - referred to as POE-$\Delta$, which is rooted in design and engineering and is aimed at providing systematic support for representing, structuring and exploring change problems of socio- technical nature. We generalise an existing theory of greenfield design as problem solving for application to change problems, using a design science research methodology. From a theoretical perspective POE-$\Delta$ is a subset of its parent framework, allowing the seamless integration of greenfield and brownfield design to tackle change problems. Its initial case study evaluation, consisting in its application to a real-world change problem of realistic complexity, shows that POE-$\Delta$ allows the systematic analysis of change problems, leading to clearer understanding and more informed decision making.},

	abstract = {Rogers characterises engineering as: [...] the practice of organising the design and construction of any artifice which transforms the physical world around us to meet some recognised need. When the artifice is software, a key challenge is learn how to recon- cile the formal world of the computing machine and its software with the non-formal physical world around it. In this paper, we describe an approach that brings both non-formal and formal aspects of software en- gineering together within a single theoretical framework, which sees soft- ware engineering practice as recordable and re-playable design theoretic transformations of software problems. The framework permits the iden- tification and clarification of software requirements, the representation of the problem world into which the software solution will be delivered, and the construction of adequacy arguments for stake-holders. Designs are recordable and re-playable through our adaptation of tactics, a (now standard) form of programming language used in transformational proof theoretic presentations. This brings to our system many other benefits of such approaches, including the ability to abstract from a captured design, and to combine programmatically captured designs. This paper provides an example-driven presentation of our framework.},

	abstract = {The paper introduces a process algebra for busi- ness process models. The algebra is located within Problem Oriented Engineering, a framework for engineering design, and is based on a process pattern defined by Hall and Rapan- otti by which Problem Oriented Engineering developments should be structured. The pattern is a generator for processes being composable in three ways: in sequence, in parallel and fractally. In explicating this process algebra, a machine readable and animatable CSP is used, which forms a semantic basis for the behaviour modelling of processes. The benefits of this algebra are: simplicity, support for business process analysis and synthesis, and explicit recognition of choices (and their impact) made by agents.},

	abstract = {The development of competent researchers is a key aspect of academic practice, and the only way to ensure continuity of our profession. It is also a key enabler of the knowledge society, with research skills in ever greater demand both in industry and academia. In the UK and elsewhere, the traditional way of developing future researchers through research degrees is under scrutiny with pressure on institutions to look beyond the needs of academia and to cater more fully for those of the working professional. In this paper we analyse the challenges raised with reference to our experience of supporting Computing professionals enrolled on part-time research degrees, contextualised in current and emergent institutional and national practices. We also propose a model of supervision we have refined over the years, in the hope that our experience can be of benefit to other academics who find themselves facing similar challenges.},

	abstract = {The proposed scale of the Global Earth Observation Systems of Systems (GEOSS) [1] suggests that its design will have all the challenges of designing Ultra-Large-Scale (ULS) systems: competing requirements, continuous evolution, heterogeneous parts, and normal failures [2]. Evidence suggests that many `traditional' design methods have difficulty handlling the challenges of ULS systems: in particular, top-down design is unlikely to converge on a viable solution and bottom-up design is unlikely to result in a useful system. To successfully work at the scale of the GEOSS, we need alternative design approaches that will allow us to converge onto a viable solution to our problem while at the same time address our ULS-specific design issues. In this position paper, we describe the method of middle-out design, which we propose as a practical design method for ultra large scale systems and a best practice for GEOSS design. In essence, middle-out design proceeds starting from a new model of systems design we call the problem view. The problem view is an addition to Kruchten's 4+1 model, and allows us to transform ULS problems inot simpler, more tractable problems that can be handled using traditional design and development methods.},

	abstract = {The convergence of 3D simulation and social networking into current multi-user virtual environments has open the door to the new forms of interaction for learning to complement face-to-face and Web 2.0-based systems. Yet, despite a growing user community, design knowledge for virtual worlds remains patchy, particularly when it comes to an understanding of the particular nature of design in virtual environments, the relationship between virtual and real-world contexts of design, as well as the engineering issues it raises, and the management of any related risks. In this paper, we explore such issues based on our experience of the socio-technical engineering of a novel learning programme for higher education with a substantial virtual component. The project's significance stems from the large number of stake-holders involved, the relatively large-scale of the virtual world development, and the strategic significance of such a development within the learning programme. Of particular novelty is our exploration of the relationship between virtual and real-world contexts of design, indicating when they align and differ, showing when tools and techniques translate, and when new tools and techniques may be required.

strategy, reason about the effect of partially detailed candidate solution architec-

joint approach brings together many non-formal and formal aspects of organisa-

	venue = {Petri Nets 2007 (PN07)},
	year = {2007},
	abstract = {In this paper, we present an approach to specification of
IT systems that combines the use of Coloured Petri Nets (CPN) and
the Problem Oriented Software Engineering (POSE) framework---an ex-
tension and generalisation of Jackson's Problem Frames to the solution
of software engineering problems. Through the case study of a package
routing system, we demonstrate how a CPN model can be used to make
appropriate POSE descriptions and support a POSE argument for the
adequacy of a problem's software solution. The suitability of CPN as
a description language for POSE is discussed and demonstrated in the
study. We found that the ability to execute CPN models offers potential
for showing adequacy of solutions, a key aspect of software engineering.
Topics. System design using nets; relationship between net theory and
other approaches; experience with using nets; higher-level net models
(CPN); application of nets to real-time and embedded systems; require-
ments engineering; Problem Oriented Software Engineering. },

	year = {2005},
	abstract = {Understanding the roles that rigour and formality can have in the design of critical systems is critical to anyone wishing to contribute to their development. Whereas knowledge of these issues is good in soft- ware development, in the use of hardware - specifically programmable logic devices (PLDs) and the combination of PLDs and software - the issues are less well known. Indeed, even in industry there are many differ- ences between current and recommended practice and engineering opin- ion differs on how to apply existing standards. This situation has led to gaps in the formal and rigorous treatment of PLDs in critical systems. In this paper we examine the range of and potential for formal specifica- tion and analysis techniques that address the requirements for verifiable PLD programs. We identify existing formalisms that may be used, and lay out the areas of contributions that academia and industry in collab- oration can make that would allow high-integrity PLD programming to be as practicable as high-integrity software development. This paper also touches briefly on some important practical, technical, organisational, social, and psychological aspects of the introduction of formal methods into industrial practice for hardware and system design. It also provides an update and summary of the recent standard 00-56, as it relates to hardware.},

Abstract. Understanding the roles that rigour and formality can have in the design of critical systems is critical to anyone wishing to contribute to their development. Whereas knowledge of these issues is good in soft- ware development, in the use of hardware - specifically programmable logic devices (PLDs) and the combination of PLDs and software - the issues are less well known. Indeed, even in industry there are many differ- ences between current and recommended practice and engineering opin- ion differs on how to apply existing standards. This situation has led to gaps in the formal and rigorous treatment of PLDs in critical systems. In this paper we examine the range of and potential for formal specifica- tion and analysis techniques that address the requirements for verifiable PLD programs. We identify existing formalisms that may be used, and lay out the areas of contributions that academia and industry in collab- oration can make that would allow high-integrity PLD programming to be as practicable as high-integrity software development. This paper also touches briefly on some important practical, technical, organisational, social, and psychological aspects of the introduction of formal methods into industrial practice for hardware and system design. It also provides an update and summary of the recent standard 00-56, as it relates to hardware.},

addressing the food gathering problem set for the 2005 CLIMA con-
test. Our system is implemented as a collection of reactive agents which
dynamically switch between a number of behaviours depending on in-
teraction with their environment. Our agents maintain no internal rep-
resentation of their environment and operate purely in response to their
immediate surroundings. The agents collectively map the environment
co-operating indirectly via environmental markers and they use these
markers to assist them in locating the depot when they discover food.
The required behaviour emerges from the interaction between agents and
the marked environment. Despite the simplicity of the agents and their
behaviours formal description is difficult. We concentrate more on identi-
fying interesting problems in characterising system exhibiting emergent
behaviour and outline possible logic approaches to dealing with them.

This short paper describes the design, development and implementation of a simple agent system aimed at addressing the food
gathering problem set for the 2005 CLIMA contest. Our system is implemented as a collection of reactive agents which dynamically switch between a number of roles depending on interaction with their environment. Our agents maintain no internal representation of their environment and operate purely in response to their immediate surroundings. The agents collectively map the environment co-operating indirectly via environmental markers and they use these markers to assist them in locating the depot when they discover food. The required behaviour emerges from the interaction between agents and the marked environment.
