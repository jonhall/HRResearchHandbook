The paper discusses methodological issues related to **using and analyzing focus groups** in social science research. It emphasizes the importance of **interactions within focus groups** and suggests that analysis should reflect these interactions. The paper also explores various **interactive features** such as dominance, construction of the Other, normative discourses, conflicts, and arguments within focus groups. Moderator strategies and analysis approaches that consider these interactions are considered.

- The paper discusses methodological issues related to **using and analyzing focus groups** in social science research.
- **Interactions within focus groups** are highlighted as a key aspect that should be reflected in data analysis.
- Various interactive features within focus groups, such as dominance, constructing the Other, normative discourses, conflicts, and arguments, are examined.
- The paper explores **possible moderator strategies** and analysis approaches to address these interactions.
- **Procedural changes** and improved moderator techniques are considered to manage tensions in focus group participation.
- The unique aspects of focus group methodology are emphasized to be related to the **interactions within the group context**.
- The analysis of focus group data should take into account the **interactive nature** of the data obtained.

Workflow: 

- Define focus groups as a controlled group discussion
- Consider group interaction as a key aspect of this methodology
- Address methodological issues such as dominant voices, constructing the Other, normative discourses, conflicts, and arguments within focus groups
- Analyze data by taking into account the interactions within the group context

Limitations

- Focus groups have limitations such as the emergence of socially acceptable opinions and dominant participants.
- These limitations can be viewed as possibilities for the method.
- Some weaknesses include certain topics being unsuitable for focus group research and the potential for views unlikely to emerge in this context.
- The use of focus groups as a quick data-gathering method may oversimplify the complexities of focus group behavior.
- Focus groups should be seen as a performance where opinions are constructed in social situations.

How to create:
- Define the purpose of the focus group
- Select participants with relevant experiences
- Plan discussion topics
- Choose a skilled moderator to guide the conversation
- Create a comfortable and open environment for participants to share their views

How to choose:
- Consider the purpose of the focus group and what information you want to gather.
- Define the target participants and ensure they represent diverse perspectives.
- Determine the number of participants based on the research objectives.
- Select a skilled moderator to guide the discussion effectively.
- Establish clear guidelines and objectives for the focus group session.},

The document discusses exoplanets and their potential for astrobiology. It outlines the methods for discovering exoplanets, presents current discoveries, and discusses future prospects. The focus is on habitability and the possibility of finding life on other planets. The document also provides a summary of properties of known exoplanetary systems.

- Exoplanets are primarily discovered through radial velocity measurements and transit photometry methods.
- The first exoplanet was discovered in 1995 orbiting the star 51 Pegasi.
- A catalogue of exoplanetary systems is regularly updated and can be found online.
- Detection methods are advancing rapidly, but sending a probe to confirm inhabited exoplanets is a distant prospect.

Fieldwork is a form of inquiry in which one is immersed personally in the ongoing social activities of some individual or group for the purposes of research. It involves personal involvement to achieve a level of understanding that will be shared with others. Fieldwork can include participant observation, interviewing, and archival research, all guided by sound human judgment, artistic decision, courtesy, and common sense.

- Discomfort and hardship such as distractions, personal failure, and lost hope
- Time constraints and the importance of not rushing through fieldwork
- The challenge of balancing participant observation and interviewing
- The need for sound human judgment and artistic decision-making in fieldwork
- The inefficiency of fieldwork in simply gathering factual data

	annote = {Definition of Triangulation: \enquote{the combination of methodologies in the study of the same phenomenon}

-- Data triangulation refers simply to using several data sources, the obvious example being the inclusion of more than one individual as a source of data. However, Denzin expands the notion of data triangulation to include time and space based on the assumption that understanding a social phenomenon requires its examination under a variety of conditions. So, for example, to study the effect of an inservice program on teachers, one should observe teachers at different times of the school day or year and in different settings such as the classroom and the teachers' lounge.

 -- Investigator triangulation, which involves more than one investigator in the research process, is also considered good practice. This perhaps more than other types of triangulation is usually built into the research process because most studies simply require more than one individual to accomplish the necessary data collection. However, the decision about who these multiple researchers should be and what their roles should be in the research process is problematic (Denzin, 1978; Miles, 1982). How much hands-on data collection the principal investigator needs to do in order to analyze the data, and how much data analysis is relegated to field workers because much of the analysis occurs as data are collected, are both relevant and not easily answered questions.

 -- Methodological triangulation is the most discussed type of triangulation and refers to the use of multiple methods in the examination of a social phenomenon. Psychologists have long used Denzin's notion of within-method triangulation in assessing psychological traits. Multiple scales comprise a psychological assessment such as an intelligence test in an effort to assess the different aspects of intelligence. The lie detector scale in some psychological inventories is another example. Denzin suggests that the within-methods triangulation approach has limited value, because essentially only one method is being used, and finds the between-methods triangulation strategy more satisfying. Other researchers seem to follow this lead and focus primarily on between methods triangulation. \enquote{The rationale for this strategy is that the flaws of one method are often the strengths of another: and by combining methods, observers can achieve the best of each while overcoming their unique deficiences} (Denzin, 1978, p. 302). It is with this type of triangulation that Denzin relies most heavily on the work of Webb et al. (1966) to suggest that the use of appropriate multiple methods will result in more valid research findings.},

	annote = {p. 13: ``Triangulation is typically perceived to be a strategy for improving the validity of research or evaluation findings: \enquote{" ...triangulation is supposed to support a finding by showing that independent measures of it agree with it or, at least, don't contradict it"} (Miles & Huberman, 1984, p. 235). It is essentially a strategy that will aid in the elimination of bias and allow the dismissal of plausible rival explanations such that a truthful proposition about some social phenomenon can be made (Campbell & Fiske, 1959; Denzin, 1978; Webb, Campbell, Schwartz, & Sechrest, 1966).''

AI summary: Triangulation is a strategy used to increase the validity of research findings. It involves using multiple data sources and methods to arrive at a singular proposition about the phenomenon being studied. However, this expectation is unrealistic as triangulation often leads to convergent, inconsistent, and contradictory evidence. Triangulation helps researchers and evaluators withstand critique by colleagues and enhances the credibility of their work. It is important to explain all outcomes of triangulation, not just the inconsistent and contradictory ones. Triangulation can be achieved through data triangulation, investigator triangulation, and methodological triangulation. The use of triangulation improves research practice by eliminating bias and allowing for the dismissal of rival explanations, leading to more truthful propositions about social phenomena.

risks: Triangulation can result in inconsistent or contradictory findings, which may pose risks to the validity of research or evaluation findings. It is important to understand that triangulation does not guarantee convergence on a single proposition about a social phenomenon. Instead, it provides a rich and complex picture that requires careful interpretation and explanation by the researcher. Triangulation should be used cautiously and researchers should be prepared to explain and make sense of the various outcomes it may produce.

- Triangulation is a strategy for increasing the validity of evaluation and research findings.
- It involves using multiple data sources and methods to reach a singular proposition about the phenomenon being studied.
- However, this expectation is unrealistic and triangulation often leads to convergent, inconsistent, and contradictory evidence.
- Triangulation helps to enhance the validity of research findings and withstand critique by colleagues.
- It is necessary to use multiple methods and sources of data in a study regardless of the philosophical or methodological perspective.
- Triangulation requires the researcher to make sense of the convergent, inconsistent, and contradictory evidence.
- Triangulation involves different types such as data triangulation, investigator triangulation, and methodological triangulation.
- Triangulation is a new concept in social science dating back to a paper published in 1959.
- Triangulation improves research practice by aiding in the elimination of bias and allowing the dismissal of rival explanations.},

@article{powell1996focus,
	annote = {AI: Focus groups are a qualitative research method that allows researchers to gather detailed and valid data by engaging participants in interactive discussions. These discussions help in understanding complex phenomena and generating new hypotheses for further study or practice. The focus group methodology involves group composition, managing group discussions, and analyzing results. It is compared to other qualitative methods like in-depth interviews and nominal group techniques. The focus group's advantage lies in its ability to quickly identify a full range of perspectives held by participants and to encourage interaction among participants to expand on their contributions.

- **Focus Groups** methodology is discussed in the document
- **Qualitative methods** permit the development of concepts to understand social phenomena
- **Focus groups** generate detailed data to formulate new hypotheses
- **In-depth interviews** and **nominal group technique** are compared to **focus groups**
- **Focus groups** allow for interaction between participants to explore complex phenomena
- **Focus groups** involve guided, interactional discussions on research topics

Workflow: - A focus group is a group of individuals selected by researchers to discuss a specific research topic from personal experience.
- Focus groups employ guided, interactional discussions to gather qualitative data.
- Focus groups are useful for eliciting information, answering research questions, and identifying a full range of perspectives.
- Focus groups should have between six and 10 participants who are strangers to each other.
- Group composition, management of group discussion, and analyzing results are important aspects of using focus groups in research.

Limitations:
- Focus groups may not be appropriate for investigating attitudes and experiences related to personal or sensitive topics.
- There may be doubts about the extent of individual participation influenced by the moderator and group dynamics.
- The process of analyzing focus group data can be time-consuming and require creative interpretation.

How to create:

- Focus groups should not be chosen based on individuals suggested by fellow group members.
- Existing knowledge of the subject should be inadequate to concentrate time and resources on the study's most pertinent variables.
- Anticipating subject loss, researchers should over-recruit participants by approximately 25\%.
- Focus groups are especially useful when the subject comprises a number of variables and psychosocial phenomena.
- Participants should come from a diverse range of backgrounds, views, and experiences.},

**There is a shift towards collaborative research where researchers work closely with those being observed.**

**Postmodernists emphasize the importance of understanding researchers' backgrounds in interpreting research results.**

**The notion of unobtrusive, objective observation is being challenged by scholars like Gregory Bateson.**

**Ethical considerations in observation and research methods are crucial in qualitative research.**

- Observation is the foundation of science and is essential for testing theories and advancing knowledge.
- Observational methods have evolved alongside scientific methods and are crucial in all scientific research.
- Observations are used in natural and human sciences, educating the senses, calibrating judgment, and picking out objects of scientific inquiry.
- Scientific observers have developed various methods over centuries to answer questions about society, nature, and more.
- 'Scientific observation' has been separated from other forms of observation over time and can include a wide array of data collected in empirical research.},

@article{james2005journaling,
	annote = {AI Summary: **Summary:** 
The article discusses the use of student journals as an assessment tool in physical education. It emphasizes the importance of organization, effective writing prompts, and grading the journal entries. Journaling provides students with a nonthreatening way to communicate their knowledge and feelings about physical education, enhancing their learning experience.

- **Journaling as an Assessment Option**
- Journaling is used to assess student learning in physical education.
- Five aspects to consider: organization, management, effective writing prompts, using journals as assessments, and grading the journal.
- Organization of journals is important for students to hold all entries.
- Writing prompts should align with learning outcomes.
- Journals provide a nonthreatening way for students to communicate their knowledge and feelings.
- Grading journal entries may not always be appropriate.
- Encourage students to personalize their journal covers.
- Writing prompts can include prompts related to sporting behavior, fitness goals, and problem-solving skills.

Tools:
- Journaling can be used as an assessment tool in physical education to evaluate student learning in the affective and cognitive domains.
- Student journals provide a nonthreatening way for students to communicate their knowledge and feelings about physical education.
- It is important to consider aspects such as organization, effective writing prompts, and grading when using student journaling as an assessment tool.
- Student journals can help identify gaps in students' cognitive learning and provide valuable insights into student perceptions of physical education.
- Teachers can use feedback methods like asking questions, providing comments, and using stickers to ensure that the journal reflects students' true feelings.
- Journals can be used to assess student learning, perceptions of learning activities, and the learning environment in physical education.

Workflow
- Journaling can be used as an assessment tool in physical education to evaluate student learning in the affective and cognitive domains. 
- It is important to consider aspects such as organization, management, effective writing prompts, using journals as assessments, and grading the journal. 
- Journals can help students communicate their knowledge and feelings about physical education in a nonthreatening way. 
- Teachers can store journals in bins or crates in an office or classroom for easy access and management. 
- Grading journal entries can be done using rubrics, checklists, or by checking for completeness, correct spelling, and readability.},

	annote = {AI Summary:
Self-reflective journaling is suggested as an assessment method in dance technique classes. The use of self-reflection integrates assessment into the learning process, focusing on personal goal setting. Teacher reflection prompts should be guided, repeated regularly, sincere, nonjudgmental, and conversational. General prompts stimulate thinking about broader class goals, while specific prompts focus on particular skills or concepts. Journal entries help students reconstruct their thoughts from class, assess understanding, show growth over time, and develop cognitive skills. The self-reflective journal can serve as an effective summative assessment tool when compared to student and teacher goals for the semester.

- Self-reflective journaling is suggested as an assessment tool in dance technique classes.
- It integrates assessment into the learning process and focuses on personal goal setting.
- Teacher reflection prompts should be guided, repeated regularly, sincere, nonjudgmental, and conversational.
- The structure of a self-reflective portfolio includes goals, student entries, and a summary reflection.
- Journal entries help students reconstruct their thoughts from class and show growth and development over time.
- Prompts can be general or specific, stimulating thinking about broader class goals or specific skills and concepts.

Tools:
- Self-reflective journaling can be used as a tool for assessment in dance technique classes.
- Journal entries allow students to reconstruct their thoughts from class, revealing their understandings about technique.
- Self-reflective writing can be integrated into the learning process and does not serve as an imposed evaluation of a student's final product.
- The self-reflection portfolio structure includes goal-setting papers, weekly student entries with instructor responses, and a summary reflection by the student.
- Teacher comments in response to student entries should be nonjudgmental and not graded.
- Self-reflective portfolios can be a valuable teaching strategy and an accurate tool for assessing progress in technique class.

Workflow:
- Self-reflective journaling can be used as a tool for assessment in dance technique classes.
- The journal entries should be collected periodically during the term to assess student understanding.
- Teacher comments should be written directly into the journal for students to reflect on.
- Journals can also be used for modifying teaching to accommodate student needs.
- The self-reflective portfolio structure should include goal-setting papers, student entries with instructor responses, and a summary reflection by the student.
- Self-reflection can aid in social and emotional development in addition to knowledge acquisition.
- Journaling allows students to reconstruct their thoughts from class and track their growth and development over time.},

@article{bacon2014journaling,
	annote = {AI-Summary: **Summary:**
The document discusses the importance of journaling in creative research, specifically in practice-led research. It highlights the role of exegesis in framing practice and the need for practitioners to establish their own research practice. The use of journaling to capture evidence of personal evolution and research progress is emphasized. The document also touches on the generative nature of writing, the process of documentation in creative research, and the significance of exegesis in reflecting on the creative process. Overall, the text emphasizes the integration of journaling and exegesis in creative research to enhance understanding and development.

- **Journaling is important in practice-led research to capture evidence of personal evolution and research process**
- **Exegesis helps practitioners establish their own research practice**
- Research outputs following academic conventions may not be impactful for wider community
- Exegesis positions itself between creative work and audience
- Practitioners need to document to substantiate knowledge in creative research
- Journal serves as a method of inquiry for practice-led researchers
- Exegesis refines the second order journal and engages in reflective learning process
- Exegesis materializes discourse and allows for critical evaluation of creative work

tools:
- Practitioners can use journals as a method of inquiry in practice-led research.
- Journaling allows for flexible ensemble of working practice, critical reflection, and research data.
- The cathartic journal especially helps in reflecting on patterns of action and capturing reflexive activity.
- Journaling can be done through a single journal or several journals with distinct purposes.
- The activity of journaling helps in kick-starting the analytical gaze at self and process.

workflow:

- Journaling is essential for documenting the creative research process and transforming initial thoughts into scholarly insights and analysis.
- It helps in capturing reflexive activities, providing data for analysis, and revealing truths about the creative process.
- Journal entries can shift from non-reflexive to reflexive, linking personal experiences to scholarly insights and immersive experiences of other writers.
- Practitioners use journals as placeholders for questions, investigations, and discussions essential to the research process.
- Exegesis and creative artifacts shape the pursuit of exploring questions opened up by the work itself.},

**Observation is the foundation of science** and is essential for testing theories and advancing knowledge in all scientific research. Observational methods have evolved alongside scientific methods and have a long history in various fields. Observations are crucial in both natural and human sciences, using tools like telescopes, microscopes, and questionnaires to make the invisible visible and the abstract concrete. Scientific observers have developed various methods to answer questions about society, the environment, and other phenomena.

- Observation is the foundation of science and is essential for testing theories and advancing knowledge.
- Observational methods have evolved alongside scientific methods and are crucial in all scientific research.
- Observations are used in natural and human sciences, educating the senses, calibrating judgment, and picking out objects of scientific inquiry.
- Scientific observers have developed various methods over centuries to answer questions about society, nature, and more.
- 'Scientific observation' has been separated from other forms of observation over time and can include a wide array of data collected in empirical research.},

The document discusses the importance of journaling as a research method in self-study of teacher education practice (S-STEP) projects. It emphasizes how journaling allows researchers to explore their experiences in practice and make sense of their self-in-practice. Despite the popularity of journaling, there is a lack of clear guidelines on how to use it as a research method in S-STEP methodology. The document also references various studies and conferences related to self-study research and journaling.



---- Journaling is a core method in self-study of teacher education practice research projects.
- It allows researchers to explore their experiences and make sense of themselves in practice.
- Journaling is not just for data collection, but also for introspection and reflection.
- There is a lack of guidelines on how to use journaling in S-STEP research.
- The meaning of journaling as a research method in S-STEP methodology needs clarification.

- Journaling is a flexible and creative research method used in self-study.
- There is no one set method for journaling; methods are chosen, created, adapted, and evolved based on the research needs.
- Journaling is often used in the self-study of teacher education practices.
- The analysis of journaling data involves thematic analysis and multiple rounds of coding.
- Journaling can be used for reflective writing, keeping notes, or as a research method in self-study.
- There is a lack of clarity and consistency in describing how journaling is used as a research method.
- Journaling is a broad and growing practice with various purposes and applications in research.},

	annote = {Statistical Thinking module discusses key elements of statistical investigation, including **p-values**, **confidence intervals**, **random sampling**, and **random assignment**. It emphasizes the importance of drawing valid inferences from data in evidence-based decision making. The module uses recent research studies to illustrate these concepts. 

The document critiques a study on the association between coffee consumption and mortality rates. It highlights the need to interpret study results carefully and understand basic statistical ideas to make informed decisions. The study found a potential link between coffee consumption and lower mortality rates, but caution is advised in drawing conclusions.

**Key Vocabulary:** Cause-and-effect, Confidence interval, Distribution, Generalizability, Margin of error, Parameter, Population, P-value, Random assignment, Random sampling, Statistic, Statistical significance.

**Learning Objectives:** Define elements of a statistical investigation, understand the role of p-values and confidence intervals, recognize the importance of random sampling and random assignment, and critique statistical studies.

- Statistical Thinking module highlights key elements of a statistical investigation using four recent research studies.
- **Understanding basic ideas of statistics is crucial for making informed decisions and setting policies.**
- **Statistics allows us to systematically study phenomena of interest rather than relying on anecdote and intuition.**
- P-value, random sampling, random assignment, statistic significance, and generalizability are important concepts in statistical thinking.
- **Critiquing statistical studies involves analyzing research questions, sample selection, results, evidence strength, and study conclusions.**
- **Random sampling of 1,000 individuals may or may not be reasonable to draw conclusions about all U.S. adults, depending on various factors.**
- The study on coffee consumption and life expectancy raises questions about cause and effect relationships in research.
- Understanding concepts like confidence interval, distribution, parameter, and population are essential in statistical analysis.

Statistical thinking involves designing a study to collect data, analyzing patterns in the data, and drawing conclusions that go beyond the observed data. Random sampling is crucial for generalizing results, while random assignment is key for cause-and-effect conclusions. Probability models help assess random variation and estimate margin of error.

Statistical thinking involves issues such as generalizability, statistical significance, cause-and-effect conclusions, and random sampling and assignment.},
