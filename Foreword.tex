\chapter{Foreword}

In doing so, you will acquire a deep knowledge of that topic, conduct a unique and novel research study, and develop and apply a wide range of research skills.

Daunting because your success will depend on you demonstrating your mastering of the topic and of the research process, that you can exercise competently a wide range of research skills, and can communicate your work effectively through an academic dissertation, possibly the largest and most demanding piece of writing you will ever undertake.

It will provide you with a solid scaffolding for you to become a competent and confident researcher. It will demystify the language around academic research and, through practical advice and activities, will help you plan, manage and execute your project work successfully from start to finish.
