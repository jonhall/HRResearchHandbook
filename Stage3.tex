\chapter{Stage 3: Second research increment}

By now you will have some mastery of the techniques and tools that you need to \enquote{do} research at masters level. You may have ideas about what you still need to do\footnote{If not, don't worry – we've got you covered with this chapter!} and so will have ideas about what come next.

With those skills, you're developing into an independent researcher\footnote{Being an independent researcher isn't one of the examined outcomes of masters research, but that you're feeling confident in your research is good.} and you may feel that this book holds nothing more for you. 

Stay with us a little longer though: the next sections aren't as long as those that you've studied already – you'll be doing more yourself, honing the skills you've picked up as you go along – but they might help to keep you systematic and on the path to submission.

You won't be surprised to know that stage 3 comes next; there's another research increment coming.

You're now $\percentthroughbook{}$ through this book – not long to go before you're finished. Stick with us for a while longer.

\section{Introducing stage 3}

In Stage 3 you will focus on adding detail to both your aim and objectives and your research design. Stage 3 assumes that you have completed your Stage 2 work, and possibly discussed it with your supervisor\footnote{If your proposal still requires some `remedial' work to fully satisfy your course requirements then you should carry that out before moving on.}, particularly your research design choices.

With reference to our 5-stage framework, the activities which are in focus in Stage 3 are recalled in Table~\ref{tab:stage3acts}, which also provides some guidelines for your interaction with your supervisor during this stage.

\begin{table}[htbp]

\begin{question}[subtitle={Activity: Understanding the effort needed in this stage}] Consider Table~\ref{tab:stage3acts} carefully, taking notice of the entries in the `Effort within stage' column. Write down the most time-consuming activities in this stage and what is expected under each.

\begin{solution}Developing your research design further and conducting your pilot work will constitute your major effort in this stage (55\% of the study time in total): your pilot work will be an initial test of some aspects of your research design, including a proof-of-concept application of some of your chosen methods.
\end{solution}\end{question}

\section{Identifying tasks and deliverables}
Recall from Stage 1 that 
%
\begin{itemize}
\item your research aim tells the reader how your research will address the knowledge gap that you have found through your literature review, 
\item your objectives help you break it down into 3 to 4 high-level steps you must take to achieve the aim.
\end{itemize}
%

\paragraph{}
It is now time to break your research objectives down even further, into tasks to help you plan your detailed research work to meet each of them. While a research objective indicates what you need to achieve, \textbf{research tasks} specify the work that you need to complete to get there, so they address the question of what you need to do to meet the objective.

For the sake of argument, we'll be working with the following objectives, which you saw in Example~\ref{ex:machinelearning} in Stage 1\footnote{See page~\pageref{ex:machinelearning}.}\todo{What was the research problem?}:

\begin{example}{Recap: Applying Machine Learning}
Given the following research aim:

\emph{to apply Machine Learning (ML) to improve the accuracy of resources and time forecasting in the context of small engineering plants}

Some related objectives could be the following:
%
\begin{description}%[start=0,label={(\bfseries R\arabic*):}]
\item [Objective 1] To identify which ML techniques are applicable to resource and time forecasting in the context of small engineering plants

\item [Objective 2] To test the accuracy of forecasting of those techniques

\item [Objective 3] To provide recommendations as to how integrate those techniques effectively in engineering practice in order to improve forecasting accuracy
\end{description}
%
where
%
\begin{description}%[start=0,label={(\bfseries R\arabic*):}]
\item [Objective 1] allows us to identify specific ML techniques to be used in the project, to ensure the work is feasible within the time-frame of the project. 
\item [Objective 2] allows us to investigate and compare how accurate the chosen techniques are in their forecasting application. 
\item [Objective 3] allows us to draw some conclusions from the research conducted and make recommendations to improve professional practice.
\end{description}
%

Note how those objectives build on each other and, if successfully completed, they contribute to meet the overall aim.
\end{example}


Closely related to tasks are \textbf{deliverables}: these are the tangible things produced by your task work.

\begin{example}{Example -- cont'd}In our example, the first objective is met once we have identified the relevant ML techniques. There are two complementary ways to do this: to look at the literature and to ask practitioners. As a result, we could break this objective down into the tasks, and deliverables, indicated in the following table

\paragraph{Table}

\textbar{} \textbf{Objective} \textbar{} \textbf{Tasks} \textbar{} \textbf{Deliverables} \textbar{}
\textbar{} :----- \textbar{} :----- \textbar{} :----- \textbar{}
\textbar{} \textbf{To identify which ML techniques are applicable to resource and time forecasting in the context of small engineering plants} \textbar{} to investigate the academic literature in order to identify relevant ML techniques \textbar{} a collection of relevant ML techniques reported in the literature \textbar{}
\textbar{} \textbar{} to ask practitioners which techniques they employ \textbar{} a collection of relevant ML techniques used in professional practice \textbar{}\end{example}

\begin{question}[subtitle={ACTIVITY: Establishing tasks and deliverables}] Consider your research objectives. For each, identify related tasks and deliverables.

\begin{guidance}You should draw a table similar to that in our running example. You should ensure that the tasks provide a reasonable break down of your objectives into discrete pieces of work.
\end{guidance}\end{question}

\color{black}

\paragraph{}
Your tasks and deliverables don't need to be perfect at this stage, and are likely to be revised as you progress through your project. However, it is important that you have thought about specific work you will need to carry out to meet your objectives.

\section{Relating tasks to research methods}
The way to carry out your tasks and meet your objectives is through the application of research methods.

\begin{example}{EXAMPLE - cont'd }Following on from our previous example, we have extended the table to include an indication and justification of candidate research methods for each task.

\paragraph{TABLE}
\textbar{} \textbf{Objective} \textbar{} \textbf{Tasks} \textbar{} \textbf{Deliverables} \textbar{} \textbf{Relevant research methods} \textbar{} \textbf{Justification and feasibility} \textbar{}
\textbar{} :----- \textbar{} :----- \textbar{} :----- \textbar{} :----- \textbar{} :----- \textbar{}
\textbar{} \textbf{To identify which ML techniques are applicable to resource and time forecasting in the context of small engineering plants} \textbar{} to investigate the academic literature in order to identify relevant ML techniques \textbar{} a collection of relevant ML techniques reported in the literature \textbar{} review of existing literature \textbar{} I can access relevant literature via my university library \textbar{}
\textbar{} \textbar{} to ask practitioners which techniques they employ \textbar{} a collection of relevant ML techniques used in professional practice \textbar{} questionnaire, possibly followed by interviews \textbar{} I have access to professional networks, which I could use to distribute the questionnaire, and possibly to recruit participants for follow-up interviews \textbar{}\end{example}

\paragraph{}
Note that the choice of research methods in relation to your research tasks is an essential part of your research design. In fact, the two influence each other: your objectives and related tasks direct you towards specific research methods, which in turn have to be part of your overall research design.

\begin{question}[subtitle={ACTIVITY: Associating methods to tasks and deliverables}] Extend your tasks and deliverables table with your candidate research methods, including stating why they apply and are feasible for your project. Revise your research design draft from Stage 2 so that is consistent with those choices.

\paragraph{GUIDANCE }
Refresh your understanding of chosen research methods from the study work you carried out in Stage 2. It is important you keep reviewing your choices with your supervisor.\end{question}
%%Hack to correct tcbox behaviour
\color{black}

\section{Detailing research procedures}
Once you have chosen the set of research methods you will apply, you must establish exactly how you will do that, something we refer to as \textbf{research procedures}.

Your research procedures will be method specific, in that each method you choose to apply will come with recommended practices, which you will need to contextualise to your own project needs, including your access to participants, data or other kind of evidence. For instance, there are plenty of guidelines in the literature on how to design questionnaires, including which type of questions to include and how to phrase them. There are also recommendations concerning testing the questionnaire design prior to its use, and of course, there are many ways a questionnaire can be administered. In writing your procedures for this research method, you would have to be specific on how each of the above applies in your project.

It is important, therefore, that you master the research methods of your choice, starting by reviewing once again the related academic literature.

\begin{question}[subtitle={Activity: Sketching research procedures}] Consider the research methods you intend to apply, and the related review you conducted in Stage 2. Reconsider those materials, possibly going back to the literature sources, to learn how to apply the methods effectively within your project.

For each method, sketch possible procedures of application, ensuring you make appropriate reference to the literature you have reviewed and best practice guidelines therein.

\begin{guidance}It is possible that the review you conducted in Stage 2 is not sufficient, in which case you will need to extend it to complete this activity.

You should focus on practical aspects of applying the methods, including specific processes and techniques to gather, summarise and present your evidence in your reports.

Depending on the extent you need to review further academic literature, this activity could be quite substantial, so you should set aside up to 20\% of your study time to complete it.

\end{guidance}\end{question}

\color{black}

\section{Assessing validity}
As your intended research design becomes clearer, you will soon be testing some aspects of it in your pilot work. Before you do that, however, you need to consider if the choices you have made will allow you to gather evidence and derive findings in a systematic, rigorous, repeatable and reliable fashion so as to address your research problem. This is referred to as assessing the overall \textbf{validity} of your research design, which is broken down into the following considerations.

\textbf{Construct validity} asks whether you have put your design together logically by focusing on the relationship between evidence and research problem. Here you ask yourself whether the evidence you will generate through your chosen research design will be accurate and relevant to address your research problem. This tests the logical coherence of your aim, objectives, tasks, methods and deliverables in relation to the research problem and the knowledge gap you intend to address. With construct validity, you are asking: \emph{have I designed my research in the right way?}

\textbf{Internal validity} is concerned with the way you gather and analyse evidence. All research strategies and methods come with recommendations of good practice to ensure that your research is both systematic, repeatable and reliable. In your work, you need to ensure that you follow such practices and are aware of possible pitfalls. For instance, in experimental research you need to control all factors which may effect outcomes beyond those under study: failing to exercise such control will lead to observations and measurements which are unreliable. In assessing internal validity, you should also take into account limitations of human perception and cognition, and any potential personal bias. With internal validity, you are asking: \emph{have I executed my research in the right way?}

\textbf{External validity} relates to the extent you will be able to generalise your findings beyond the immediate context of your research. For instance, you may conduct a case study within a specific organisation, so here you are asking whether and how what you have discovered may apply to other organisations. With external validity, you are asking: \emph{will my research lead to findings that apply somewhere else?}

Anything that gets in the way of validity in research is termed a \textbf{threat to validity}. Different research strategies and methods are exposed to different threats, something you should have encountered in your review of the literature on your chosen methods.

\begin{question}[subtitle={Activity: Assessing validity of research design}] Conduct an initial assessment of your chosen research design in relation to the three kind of validity discussed above. Write down a short summary of your thinking in support of each, and of possible threats to validity you envisage.

\begin{guidance}You may need to refer back to the literature you have reviewed to identify specific threats which apply to your chosen research methods and strategies.

You won't be able to address this in full at this point in your project, particularly the internal validity, which refers to the execution of your research design. Nevertheless, it is important for you to consider validity and possible threats from the onset. You will return to this topic at the end of your project, as part of the overall assessment of your research, to reflect on the validity of your completed research.

\end{guidance}\end{question}

\section{Conducting your pilot work}

Your \textbf{pilot work} will be a small scale test of some of the methods and procedures you will apply in the next stage of your project. Its main function is to help you assess the feasibility of your research design, or at least some aspects of it, and build your confidence in the approach you have chosen.

As such, your pilot work may not contribute directly to your aim and objectives, but it should help you decide whether you can actually do what you have planned to do, or inform how your research design and project plan should change instead.

There are no constraints on what you can do for your pilot work, other than you should exercise some aspect of your research design. It is therefore essential that you you agree what you are going to do with your supervisor first.

\begin{question}[subtitle={Activity: Planning and executing your pilot work}] Plan your pilot work and discuss your plan with your supervisor.

Once you have agreed the way forward, execute your plan and write a summary of both its execution and outcomes.

\begin{guidance}Your summary should include:

- an indication of which aspects of your research design your pilot work was concerned with

- any methods and procedures applied

- any data or evidence gathered, including possible modelling, artefact design or prototyping, appropriately presented and summarised

- lessons learnt and any resulting revision to your research design and project plan, particularly in relation to construct and internal validity of your research design.

To complete this activity successfully, it is essential that you agree your pilot work plan with your supervisor upfront, and discuss your progress on a regular basis.

This is a substantial activity, which will take you up to 35\% of your study time.
