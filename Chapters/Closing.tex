\chapter{Submission}
Your dissertation submission concludes your research project work. Congratulations!	

%\section{Concluding remarks}\label{sect:ConcludingRemarks}
If you have come this far you should be very pleased as it is a significant intellectual achievement. A successful project is a strong indication that you have mastered a wider range of research and transferrable skills which are of great value to your professional development and provide a strong foundation for any future academic or professional research you may choose to pursue.

We hope you have found conducting your own research rewarding despite – or perhaps because of! – the challenges that undoubtably you will have overcome during your project. We also hope you will have found this handbook valuable in supporting you throughout your project.

We wish you all the best for your future career and studies!
